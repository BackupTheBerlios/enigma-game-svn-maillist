+You are on the Yin side of this article. The Yang side is &lt;a href=&quot;$$lotm_200904_yang$$&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

+&lt;hr&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;This month we are presenting to you another level designed by Jacob the Buil
+&hellip; Sorry, by Jacob Scott. This author has become a legend not only among
+Enigma players, but, as we already know (see LotM 7/2008) in the world of
+marbles as well. He produces new excellent levels at such an astonishing speed
+that some Enigma connoisseurs started to doubt if he is a human at all (see LotM
+7/2007) and I should say their arguments sound rather convincing. &lt;/p&gt;

+
+&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, initially we were at a loss as to how we should write an
+article about a level like this. It seemed to us it was next to impossible to
+write an article that wouldn't become one huge spoiler for the level. But then
+we thought: why write anything ourselves if we can offer the readers the
+first-hand experience of a person who saw the level from within? &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Puzzled? We mean Henry Blackball, of course. Yes, you are right, the very
+Henry Blackball, the famous traveler, the marble who ventured into more worlds
+of Enigma than any marble who lived before or after him. Already during his
+lifetime he became a legend. And when at the beginning of Age 1.0 he published
+his book &quot;Against the Four Elements and Other Adventures&quot; which became
+an instant bestseller he truly became a household name. His mysterious fate only
+strengthened the public interest in him: soon after the book was published he
+forsook the fame and wealth that came to him as a bestselling writer and
+embarked on his second journey to the World of Gods, leaving behind his fianc&eacute;,
+the beautiful Anna Whiteball. As constant readers of our LotM section must have
+guessed, he never came back. Neither did Anna Whiteball, who, anxious for Henry,
+soon left her house too, intent on aiding him in his journey. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Those readers who have solved the level will probably notice that Henry
+Blackball was not the most accurate narrator. In his book he mixed truth and
+fiction, and many years after his disappearance marbles still argued how much of
+his book he actually experienced and how much he made up. The readers will
+notice that sometimes Henry's narrative does look rather improbable. Some of the
+things he describes in this chapter have never been seen by other travelers who
+ventured into that world after him, which probably means that he's made those
+things up. Or has he? The worlds of Enigma are known to mysteriously change
+sometimes. Short and easy ways to the oxyds sometimes mysteriously disappear,
+and new obstacles arise. Maybe the world in question has undergone some changes
+as well since the time Henry visited it. Nevertheless, we had to omit some parts
+of the chapter for they would be too much of a spoiler for the readers who have
+not yet solved the level. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;For our article we used the definitive edition published by Marble Press. The
+first edition of Henry's book was heavily censored by the marble government who
+did not want to make the information about some of the Enigma worlds public.
+Later on, when struggle for white marble rights started to arise passages that
+did not go in line with political correctness were cut from his book as well.
+Even his hilarious remarks about smallballs, little insect-like creatures who
+travel from world to world through special types of holes in the floor, were
+omitted, though up to now no one has managed to prove that smallballs have even
+the slightest interest in what marbles think of them. This edition, based on a
+manuscript found in Henry's attic years after his disappearance, is the first to
+contain the complete text of his famous book. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h3&gt;Against the Four Elements and Other Adventures&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;by Henry Blackball&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;Chapter 23: How I Excelled in Planning Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Slowly I opened my eyes. The narrow escape from the rotor was still vivid in
+my memory. I had touched the last oxyd in that crazy place just a moment before
+the damn creature would have broken me. I was lucky to transport myself and
+Monday[1] in time. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200904_a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;It was a rather &lt;br&gt; beautiful places &hellip;&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Monday &hellip; Where is he? Ah, there, on the other side of the &hellip;
+Pond? Yes, there's a pond here, and &hellip; For the first time I really saw the
+place. It was a rather beautiful place, small, with lovely dark red floor and
+grey walls. There was a pond there, blocked by yellow walls on two sides, two
+one-way passages (I noticed that the floor there had started to crumble, need to
+take that into account if I actually have to use them), a few seeds were
+scattered on the floor and next to them lay an old worn-out bag. &quot;I wonder
+what happened to the poor soul who abandoned it&quot; I thought. But I decided
+that it's better not to dwell too much on that. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;And to the right were the oxyds. The oxyds? So easy to reach? The gods who
+made the multiple worlds of Enigma were rarely so benevolent. Is there a hidden
+oxyd somewhere? I looked around. There were a few other oxyds on Monday's side
+of the pond. Now we'll just have to open them in turn, and then Monday will come
+here through the one-way passage and open the last one behind the white-hemmed
+stone. So easy? I felt relieved and disappointed at once. Relieved, because I'm
+not likely to get stuck in that place for a year, trying to solve some hard
+puzzle, or risk the valuable extralives, fleeing from rotors. Disappointed,
+because you will hardly gain any fame, exploring worlds like this. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;As the world seemed rather easy, and there was no immediate danger there I
+decided that I had time for research. I took from my pocket a book I never
+parted with: &quot;Which God Has Made This Particular World?&quot; by William
+Whiteball[2]. For a millionth time I wondered why I kept on consulting the book.
+How can we possibly be sure that the gods of Enigma existed at all, let alone
+know what elements each of them preferred when creating worlds. But on the other
+hand &mdash; the old marble is said to have delved into many forbidden
+mysteries, to have visited strange places and read the writings no marble has
+cast an eye upon for millennia. Maybe there is at least a grain of truth in his
+book. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Ok, question 1: &quot;Have you been trying to solve the puzzles in this world
+for months, in spite of the fact that there's nothing hidden here? If it is true
+then go to question 2, if it is false go to question 5.&quot; Ha, no, the world
+is much simpler than I would like it to be. Question 5: &quot;Are you being
+chased by a crazy clock?&quot; Gods, of course I'm not! If I were, I wouldn't be
+reading your bloody book, stupid old fart. Question 10 &hellip; Question 11
+&hellip; Question 39 &hellip; Finally! &quot;Your world has most likely been
+created by the legendary Jacob the Builder&quot;. Ok, and now will you please
+give any proof that Jacob the Builder existed at all? No, you won't, 'cause you
+don't have any. But enough of that! Let's open the oxyds and move on to a more
+interesting place. &quot;Hey, Monday!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200904_b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;The stupid creature &lt;br&gt; had lost its Yin Yang!&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;But suddenly a frightening thought occurred to me. The stupid creature had
+lost its Yin-Yang! Well, you can't expect someone whose last name is Whitebrush
+to be particularly bright, but that's a little too much even for him[3]. Fear
+gripped my heart with its cold icy fingers. I'm stuck in this place forever! No
+one will come to my rescue! But then I told myself, &quot;Well, Henry, don't
+panic! Sooner or later you'll be able to think of something&quot;. I slowly
+looked around one more time. What do I have at my disposal?
+One&mdash;two&mdash;three &mdash;four&mdash;five seeds, a bag, two dynamite
+sticks behind one-way stones over there. Not that bad. There must be some way to
+put them to use, there must be &hellip; &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I saw what I could do. Great! The creature on the other side of the
+pond doesn't have seeds, but he needs them. I've got seeds, and a bag as well.
+So I can send him a few. The one-ways are crumbling, so most likely I'll have
+only one opportunity to travel across the pond and back. So how many seeds do I
+need to give Monday? Do I need to take anything with me from the other side of
+the pond? I pondered a little more. [..] &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;I entered the one-way passage, carrying just the necessary number of seeds in
+my bag. I couldn't but admire what a clever idea I had. Any other marble would
+get stuck in this place forever. But I found a way out even without a second
+Yin-Yang. When I entered Monday's half of the room I turned back and saw the
+last remnants of the floor crumble down. Just as I had already guessed I won't
+be able to use that passage anymore. Quickly I rolled to Monday, gave him the
+bag, and told him about my plan. His eyes widened in wonder at my cleverness.
+The poor creature must have already lost all his hope to get out of here and
+been silently beweeping his fate[4]. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Leaving the bag behind, I rolled to the dynamite stick behind a one-way
+stone. Suddenly something clicked. Gods, no! An invisible trigger! I madly
+looked around. A floor tile near the place where Monday lay had disappeared.
+Just that? Well, even for Monday it won't be that difficult to avoid the abyss.
+But suddenly I saw a flicker of movement there. Oh, no! A rotor jumped from the
+abyss. Then another &hellip; And another. They immediately directed towards
+Monday. I ran to intercept them. Just as the first of them was a hair's width
+behind Monday I was there. I pushed the white ball so that he rolled beyond
+their attention span. Now I need to entice them back to the abyss where they
+came from. I turned to the right. Then to the left. Then right again. Quickness
+and dexterity. That's what you need when dealing with rotors. I had to be
+careful. A little too slow, and they would break me to pieces. A little too
+fast, and they would loose sight of me. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200904_c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Just as the first of them was &lt;br&gt; a hair's width
+behind &lt;br&gt; Monday I was there.&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Here it is! The abyss! Suddenly I swerved to the left and ran as fast as I
+could. The slow-witted creatures didn't notice it at first and continued to run
+to the abyss. Delighted, I saw them falling down one after the other. Done! Now
+let's take that dynamite. But suddenly I saw another flicker of movement in the
+abyss. Are they coming back? No, it's something different. Crazy clock! Again it
+directed towards the helpless Monday. I rolled as fast as I could and hit it
+when it was just one step behind Monday. It turned its face to me. I left the
+tile just a fraction of a second before it was there. Then I guided it to the
+wall, praying to gods that it doesn't turn by itself until we are done opening
+the oxyds. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;I took the dynamite and ran back to my half of the room, hearing the tiles
+crumble behind me. Suddenly I heard something else. I looked back. The clock! It
+started moving! [..] I pushed the last box into the water just when the clock
+was one step behind Monday once more. Another moment, and it will be on the same
+tile where Monday is! But thankfully, the creature decided to change direction.
+I gave a sigh of relief and released the control of the place to Monday. Now,
+friend, don't let me down! I believe in you! [..] &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;I watched Monday finish the bridge, wondering how cleverly he avoided the
+crazy clock while faithfully sticking to my plan. I had definitely
+underestimated him. Soon all the oxyds were opened except the one behind the
+white-hemmed stone. Just then I saw the crazy clock turning to me. &quot;Monday!
+Quickly!&quot; I prayed. I doubted he could hear me. It's not easy to
+communicate in a place where there are closed oxyds without a Yin-Yang. But I
+saw him quickly moving to the oxyd. Another moment, and the oxyd emitted
+beautiful light. I didn't wait any longer. Immediately I left the place, taking
+Monday with me. As the room blurred in front of my eyes I wondered for a
+millionth time what the next world that I saw would be like, what beautiful or
+horrible things I would see there. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;

+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Just then I saw the crazy &lt;br&gt; clock turning to me.&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;Annotations by the editor:&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;[1] A white marble whom Henry met on one of his journeys. His real name was
+Jeremy Whitebrush. He traveled with Henry a lot and was a great help in many of
+his adventures. No one knows why Henry called him Monday. When asked about it in
+an interview he replied, &quot;I called him Monday because I first met him on
+Thursday&quot;. That's about all the information we've got. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;[2] Probably the most famous scholar of his time. His works, among which one
+could name the definitive treatise &quot;On the Multiple Worlds of Enigma&quot;,
+a questionnaire for travelers &quot;Which God has Made This Particular
+World&quot; and the bestselling &quot;Item Transformation for Dummies&quot;, are
+widely known in the world of marbles. He was the father of Anna Whiteball who
+later became Henry's fianc&eacute;. After his daughter's disappearance he took to
+drinking and was often seen in the street with an open bottle, mumbling to
+himself, &quot;It's all my fault, only mine&quot;. Suddenly he stopped appearing
+in the street. When his neighbors, worried by his long absence, broke into his
+house they saw that his papers and books were scattered around on the floor.
+Their owner never appeared again. Some marbles claim they have spotted him in
+some remote corners of the Universe of Enigma, but their credibility is widely
+doubted. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;[3] Let us forgive Henry his prejudices. He was a marble of his time, and in
+the age when the book was written the struggle for political correctness has
+only started to hatch. In his defense we can say that his love for the beautiful
+Anna Whiteball changed him a lot and in the last years of his life he became a
+well-known and influential champion of white marbles' rights. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;[4] As Jeremy Whitebrush later explained in his interview, actually he had
+found a way out long ago and was just waiting for the moment when Henry would
+deign to talk to him. &lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+&quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is actually one of my more recent levels. I designed it
+kind of in the spirit of my &quot;Seed Puzzle&quot; (and related) levels, but with
+a little twist: now there are two marbles to control, but only one
+yin-yang. As much as I enjoyed creating the &quot;Seed Puzzle&quot; levels (and
+similar ones, such as &quot;Versailles&quot; and &quot;One-Way Streets&quot;), and as much
+as I hope people enjoyed completing them, I thought they were missing
+something. Their puzzles were (in my opinion) fairly hard and good, but
+the levels had little variety, essentially containing just seeds,
+water/abyss, one-ways, and occasionally bombs. For &quot;Plan Ahead&quot;, I took
+the opposite strategy: use more than a few different level elements that
+all relate to seeds and that can all come together to form a cohesive
+landscape. In my opinion &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is easier than most of my other
+seed puzzle levels, but the concept is much less obvious, in that the
+solution is not simply deciding which grates to destroy with seeds, but
+rather involves interacting with a bunch of different items. This may
+not increase the difficulty of the puzzle at all, but I think it
+certainly makes it more interesting.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Looking back, &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; seems to contrast significantly with most of
+the other puzzle levels I've designed. The majority of them tend to
+involve either searching around some sort of labyrinth (like &quot;Labyrinth
+of Puzzles&quot; or &quot;Almost There&quot; or even &quot;Map it Out&quot;, for a few
+representatives) or a complex, single-themed puzzle (the &quot;Alien Glyphs&quot;
+series, &quot;Now What?&quot;, or &quot;Open Path&quot;, for example). Some are larger
+conglomerations of these, but relatively few have the diversity &quot;Plan
+Ahead&quot; does in proportion to their size. They also generally have
+darker color themes and less-inviting atmospheres about them; instead,
+&quot;Plan Ahead&quot; has a much fresher feel to it, which I believe reflects its
+change in puzzle design. &quot;Plan Ahead&quot;, I hope, provides a refreshing
+take on the theme of seed puzzles, this time set in a colorful and
+peaceful world that will challenge but reward all adventurers who choose
+to play within it.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I would like to make a couple of general comments about Enigma levels,
+and by extension game levels in general, concerning what it means to be
+&quot;elegant&quot;. In my opinion &quot;a level is elegant&quot; means first that no part
+of the level is arbitrary (and a unique solution exists) and second that
+it is the most difficult of all such levels with the same overall
+structure. For example I believe &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; is in some sense &quot;solid&quot;;
+it has a (fairly) unique solution, and there are no conspicuous
+additions for the sole purpose of preventing alternate solutions &mdash; the
+puzzle all fits together well. Furthermore, the puzzle seems to be
+&quot;maximally difficult&quot; for the given setup; that is, there is no small
+tweak one could make to increase its difficulty (without changing its
+overall structure; this generally means all items must be used, for
+example). I believe it is somewhat rare for a level to satisfy both
+conditions (it's structure admits just one solution without arbitrary
+modifications and it is as difficult as possible); I think that when a
+level does so, it is what one usually considers &quot;elegant&quot;, and otherwise
+probably is not. Elegance, then, seems to be the overall goal of
+designing a level &mdash; the elegant levels are those that best challenge
+the player and reward them the most upon completion. I hope this is the
+case for &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; and that &quot;Plan Ahead&quot; provides a refreshing trip
+to a small lake, almost impassable except through Henry Blackball's
+careful planning ahead.
