   &lt;h3 class=&quot;lotm&quot;&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;March 2007: &lt;/span&gt;
-  The Unwritten Level
+  Island Labyrinth
+  &lt;span class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;input/lotm/lotm_200703.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/h3&gt;
 
-  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;input/lotm/lotm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
-
   &lt;p&gt;Starting with today, we want to take a closer look on excellent levels
   each month, and excellent levels being those with the highest average user
-  ratings, yet at least 5 ratings all together.&lt;/p&gt;
+  ratings and enough ratings altogether; so please rate those levels you
+  play.&lt;/p&gt;
 
-  &lt;p&gt;Until we have enough ratings together to unmistakenly choose the first
-  Level of the Month, I want to concentrate on that levels not yet written,
-  which apriori is a quite difficult task. So, what might come to us in
-  Enigma's future? There are several, even very old objects in Enigmas source
-  code that aren't extensively used yet, and might find a more important role
-  in future levels. I want to take a look at three of them today.&lt;/p&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;Any association with the following combination?&lt;/p&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;input/lotm/lotm_200703_a.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;Okay, the title of this article might have influenced you already. But I
+  guess, even without this interference, most gamers that got to pack V would
+  have unhesitatingly said: This is from &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;
 
-  &lt;p&gt;As of my own impression, one of the most underestimated items is
-  &lt;i&gt;it-spoon&lt;/i&gt;. Yes, you might say it's useless. It shatters your marble
-  and has just the same effect as F3. The only other way to use it would be to
-  block a laser beam and force the user to shatter the marble this way. Apart
-  from thoughts to eliminate F3, there is more to &lt;i&gt;it-spoon&lt;/i&gt;: While F3
-  shatters all marbles in a level, &lt;i&gt;it-spoon&lt;/i&gt; only shatters the marble
-  that uses it. As soon as the player encounters the necessity to sacrifice
-  one of his marbles, he has to plan which one, and has to do this
-  &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; he picks up the spoon. It perfectly combines with
-  &lt;i&gt;it-flag&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;st-mail&lt;/i&gt;, even in two ways: &lt;i&gt;st-mail&lt;/i&gt; may not
-  only be used to define the new position of the marble via a flag, but also
-  to transfer the spoon from one marble to another. The first variant is
-  realized in &quot;Cold Mail&quot; (V/84). However, one need not use the
-  spoon here, F3 does as well. But with more marbles in the level, the author
-  is able to force the player to use &lt;i&gt;it-spoon&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;Based on the preliminary statistics from Febuary, Jacob Scott's excellent
+  level got an overwhelmingly positive rating of three flashing 10s and one
+  appreciative 7, averaging to 9.25. When browsing the ratings, you might come
+  across a rate-10-level. However, those are not yet rated by four or
+  more players, so &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; took the cake for this
+  month.&lt;/p&gt;
 
-  &lt;p&gt;Another very interesting item I want to promote here is
-  &lt;i&gt;it-changefloor&lt;/i&gt;. This really scarce item is again of greatest use in
-  multi-marble-levels. Play the original Per.Oxyd-Link-Level 69 to see it in
-  action. It changes &lt;i&gt;fl-acblack&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fl-acwhite&lt;/i&gt; when an actor
-  leaves the tile. This way the marble can be forced to use a floor only
-  once, or to dare and use its impulse. This is not only in mazes of
-  interest. Combine it with &lt;i&gt;st-death&lt;/i&gt; and what you get is another kind of
-  jump! Together with a second marble, the situation might totally change, not
-  only in yinyang-levels but also in meditations or levels with two or more
-  black marbles, with killerballs and horses. And &lt;i&gt;it-ring&lt;/i&gt; and
-  &lt;i&gt;st-flash&lt;/i&gt; can be used to once again give another twists to this
-  one.&lt;/p&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; was the final level Jacob provided for
+  Enigma 0.92. Correspondingly, it was assigned quite to the end of the old
+  0.92-pack &quot;Enigma 3&quot;, leaving the prestigious last place of this
+  pack to &quot;Stay in the Spotlight&quot;. In the tradition of Oxyd, the
+  final level in a level pack often featured some larger, more involved and
+  more complex level than the preceding - and, with Enigma 1.00, &quot;Island
+  Labyrinth&quot; indeed was assigned to be master level of Pack V. (Small
+  annotation to this: Jacob's &quot;Patterns&quot; was the direct predecessor
+  of &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with Enigma 0.92, and today is a master
+  level of its own.)&lt;/p&gt;
 
-  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;it/st-brake&lt;/i&gt; is my third candidate. Did you know that one can
-  destroy &lt;i&gt;it-blocker&lt;/i&gt; with this? Of course, &lt;i&gt;st-bolder&lt;/i&gt; is the
-  obvious partner to &lt;i&gt;it/st-brake&lt;/i&gt;; but this combination between
-  &lt;i&gt;it/st-brake&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;it/st-blocker&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;st-bolder&lt;/i&gt; multiplies the
-  significance of brakes by several multitudes and really allows to construct
-  logical puzzles mainly based on &lt;i&gt;it/st-brake&lt;/i&gt;. But there is another way
-  to use it. Ever mailed a stone? Mail an &lt;i&gt;it-seed&lt;/i&gt;? Won't really work,
-  the seed starts growing as soon as it arrives. You can mail an
-  &lt;i&gt;it-seed&lt;/i&gt; inside &lt;i&gt;it-bag&lt;/i&gt;, another quite scarce item. But you
-  could as well mail &lt;i&gt;it/st-brake&lt;/i&gt;. This is one of the few ways to mail
-  more than one item: You can mail &lt;i&gt;it-brake&lt;/i&gt; and e.g. &lt;i&gt;it-umbrella&lt;/i&gt;
-  both through the same stone, as the brake will instantly become
-  &lt;i&gt;st-brake&lt;/i&gt;. Not even the sequence is important to this! Interesting
-  enough, if there already is a stone at the exit of the mail pipes,
-  &lt;i&gt;it-brake&lt;/i&gt; can't be mailed. This is the only case where a stone can
-  block the exit of a mail pipe!&lt;/p&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;I want to finish our look on this level's statistics by some small
+  annotation: As of January's scores, Stupid holds the world record for
+  &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with 37:42. Head-to-head with Stupid, Ronald
+  holds second best time with 37:55; only 13 seconds (0.6 percent!) behind
+  Stupid. Taztunes is third with another reasonable score of 56:53.&lt;/p&gt;
 
-  &lt;p&gt;By the way, you can use lasers to blow up an &lt;i&gt;st-brake&lt;/i&gt;. What use
-  this has? Well, explosions melt item freezers, and destroying a blocking
-  stone might not be that a bad idea, is it? And it destroys the item below
-  it, too; although this might be an aspect we change or adapt in future
-  versions. Or you block a turnstile with an &lt;i&gt;st-brake&lt;/i&gt;, while a rotor is
-  trapped on the other side. There are lots of opportunities, once one thinks
-  about this.&lt;/p&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;In my personal view, one of the most ingratiating characteristics of this
+  level is given by Jacob's consistent design. As one rushes through the
+  little, light-gray, leafy lanes, one rarely looses sight of the second
+  important motive in this level, water. Jacob used this combination earlier,
+  in &quot;Blocks and Water&quot;, but it got to perfection in &quot;Island
+  Labyrinth&quot;. Thereby never too much in the foreground. There are more
+  design-elements, notably the sand-piles that weave quite good into the
+  island theme, the skull/gradient-combination and the ice in the South, that
+  distract more strongly from the common theme.&lt;/p&gt;
 
+  &lt;p&gt;If one compares &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; with Jacob's earlier levels,
+  you will find an obvious thematic ancestor in &quot;Labyrinth of
+  Puzzles&quot;. It exhibits the same idea of connecting many smaller puzzles
+  into one big maze, and was Jacob's final level for Enigma 0.81. Here is
+  Jacobs own view on &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+As for &quot;Island Labyrinth,&quot; I designed it in the style of the old level
+100's from Oxyd -- a large landscape that includes many diverse
+elements and difficult, but not impossible, puzzles.  I had originally
+tried to do that with &quot;Labyrinth of Puzzles,&quot; but it came out too easy
+and small (at least in my opinion) and didn't include enough different
+puzzle types.  For &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; I put in most of the puzzles
+that would fit well with the theme of the level (blocks and water,
+lasers, dense blocks) in a much larger and better-designed maze.  I
+also managed to include some more atypical puzzles and features, my
+favorite being the unexpected (but not at all hidden) way to activate
+one of the oxyds.  As a whole it came out reasonably well, I believe
+-- it can be solved (by me at least) in about 24 minutes, and is
+non-sequential so a player doesn't have to start over and complete the
+entire rest of the level again if he/she makes a mistake near the end
+-- the player can solve that part first next time.  It still isn't as
+hard as some of the old level 100's and is built in a different style,
+but is probably my hardest reasonably-completable level to date.  And,
+at least from the ratings, it appears to be well enjoyed by the Enigma
+community, which is the most important thing.  Good luck solving, and
+have fun!&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;Well, for me remains only to join in with Jacob: Good luck solving, and
+  have fun with this very earned level of the month!&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;Oh, and before I forget this: Don't forget to rate!&lt;/p&gt;
+
   &lt;p&gt;Greets,&lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Andreas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
