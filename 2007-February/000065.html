+&lt;h4&gt;I have an idea for a new Enigma object.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
+We do always appreciate new ideas and input. Enigma has a rather large zoo of
+objects. Every new one has to fulfill certain criterea to be selectable as a
+valuable addition.
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;It must reveal new aspects that are not yet covered by other
+objects.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;It must be good for and should inspire many new levels.&lt;/li&gt; 
+&lt;li&gt;It must be well defined in its behaviour in releationship to all other
+existing objects.&lt;/li&gt; 
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+Finally we need images, the C++ code and may be special sounds. The more you can
+deliver besides the basic idea the sooner we will evaluate and discuss your
+proposal.

+&lt;p&gt;You just have to obey the &lt;a href=&quot;$$gpl$$&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt; conditions which
+even allow you to sell Enigma under certain conditions. We can not grant anyone
+special conditions besides this open license. Please ask your lawyers if GPL
+is compabtible to your demands.&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;p&gt;We are interested in knowing the distribution of Enigma. Please drop a note

+articles about Enigma in the printed media we would be glad to receive a free
+of charge author's copy.&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;In principle: Yes. Make sure, that Enigma is complete, in particular
 all copyright-notes and credits (don't change the author-names!), a
 copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;$$gpl$$&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;, and the source code (at least a link to
 where download the source code, see GPL for details). In case your game
 compilation is commercial, you are not allowed to receive money for the
 program Enigma itself -- only a fee for the physical act of copying it and the
 media you are using.
-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

+&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;
 You're allowed to modify and extend Enigma, as long as you hold on to
 the specifications of the GPL: The new program has again to be licensed
 as GPL, in particular the source code has to be available. If you just
 write additional levels for Enigma, these need not be part of the GPL,
 and you might sell them as you like. Note however, that level-files are
 source code by themselves, so there is no way you could prohibite their
-distribution by copying and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;h4&gt;Why are the Enigma services located at so many different locations?
+What is located at Berlios, what at nongnu, what at enigma-game.org etc?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;When Enigma got public the services of Savannah (nongnu.org) seemed
+appropiated. As time went on the development switched between different
+source code repositories like Archie and CVS. Finally after release of
+Enigma 0.92 we were looking for a provider who offered Subversion repository support.
+At that point of time Berlios was one of the few that offered the required
+services. Thus you will find the post 0.92 development on Berlios and older
+repositories at Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Other services like the Forum and the Wiki started and are still running
+as private services supplied by Enigma users at their addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The homepage is still served by Savannah. But this limits us to static
+contents. Thus we reserved the domain enigma-game.org, which may be used
+in future for dynamic services like score uploading, a network game server and
+more. Currently the address is redirected to Savannah and we are just using
+email services at this address.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;Is there something like an Enigma party or Enigma convention?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Not yet, but maybe you want to organize one?&lt;/p&gt;
