     &lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;The Mead-Trap&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;

+  &lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+  I am a single father and my daughter comes to visit me twice a year. When Lori
+  visits, we like to play computer games and we were looking for a game that
+  involved the solving of puzzles.  I happend upon Enigma, when I did a google
+  search for &quot;Puzzle Games&quot; and we started playing the levels.&lt;/div&gt;
   
+  &lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+  After we had solved about 95% of the levels, we began to develop a feeling for
+  what kind of levels we liked and what kind of levels we thought were just
+  &quot;a-pain-in-the-neck&quot;. We determined that &quot;WE&quot; liked the
+  puzzles that made you EXPLORE and THINK. We didn't like the puzzles that made
+  you HURRY nearly as much.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+  I had worked as a Senior Electronics/Software engineer for 25 years, so the
+  language for writing Enigma levels was not difficult for me, and my daughter
+  Lori actually contributed most of the really devious hiding places, and sneaky
+  puzzle attributes.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+  One concept that we had never seen in any level before was the notion that you
+  had to have a &quot;pair&quot; of tools to get back out of a trap that you
+  knew you were walking into. We designed a little trap requiring both the
+  &quot;sword, and hammer&quot; if you wanted to escape, and that was the
+  centerpiece of the level.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+  We also liked that notion that the wooden block seed must be expanded under
+  the grate to make use of it for all three of its purposes. The wooden block
+  &quot;1. Holds down a switch, 2. Changes the value of a coin, and  3. Makes a
+  bridge over the abyss&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; We had also never seen anyone hide an item underneath an
+  outer space square, where you have to plan your trajectory to recover the
+  item.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; I guess the experience from playing all of the levels in
+  version 0.82, combined with a love of puzzles, inspired us to create this
+  level.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
+  Sincerely, Barry Mead &amp; daughter Lori&lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;We remember Manuel's &lt;a href=&quot;lotm_200704.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Pneumatic
+  Delivery&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which he designed for his father. And &quot;Tool
+  Time&quot; is a joint project of father and daughter. It's great to see how
+  Enigma brings together parents and children, even without network gaming.
+  Barry, Lori, thank you very much for this important lesson, and the great
+  level you shared with us!&lt;/p&gt;
+
   &lt;p&gt;Greets,&lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Andreas and Harry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
