+
+&lt;p&gt;I've got a bit of a conflicting relationship with &quot;Pleasure Garden&quot;: 
+If all's going well, it's a pleasure indeed to go for a stroll in 
+the garden, but if I have a bad day, it seems to me more like a 
+building site - just if it were still in the planning stage but not yet
+complete. What are the single components representing then - and where 
+have all the &quot;flowers&quot; gone?&lt;/p&gt;

+        &lt;td class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;mecke&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
+&lt;/table&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;In the beginning a few planks, which are stored behind some 
+hoarding full of holes, have to be laid - to be able to place the 
+border for the &quot;small fountain&quot; in the lake. Until I found out how 
+it works. ... Must have accidentally banged my head with one of those 
+planks. ;-) Nevertheless, that's done. So off we go to the next part.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200805_b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;The fountain in the lake.&lt;br&gt;Messed it up again!&lt;br&gt;Where's the gardener?!&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;What's going on? Toolshed, &quot;mission control&quot;, lots of trellis 
+and three unfinished &quot;large fountains&quot;, but only two borders. 
+Fortunately they're not overgrown with tendrils, otherwise 
+it would be impossible to get through to the toolshed or the 
+&quot;mission control&quot;. But before we get in there, we'll have to 
+take care of the &quot;fountains&quot;. So, now the toolshed's open.
+Oh boy, it's pretty dark inside this shack, too dark to see 
+where you're going. Ah! here's the tool, bag it, then off we go 
+next door to operate the switch, and now it's time to leave this 
+part of the garden behind.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Now that we've got our tool, we can go on. We need it badly
+to uncover our path which &quot;kindly&quot; is surrounded by deep ditches. 
+In the following area of the garden we come across some labyrinth,
+which strangely enough is in good repair. At least it's granted 
+to us to have a look at some &quot;flowers&quot;. Then let's see what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The two exits from this labyrinth lead to an area, where some
+roadworks are awaiting us. Blastings at various places have to be
+carried out. But before we start the fireworks, two planks need to be 
+laid across some pit. One of them's leaning against a wall, the other's 
+stored behind a fence. ... That's that!&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;&quot;I really get a lot of pleasure from solving such a fantastic
+level!&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;So I here I am to say something about &quot;Pleasure
+Garden&quot;. All right then. It's quite a while ago that I dealt with it. It
+was a fantastic level, that I can remember. As far as I know there had not been
+too much players which had solved the level at the time, when I was playing it.
+Had it not yet been discovered by others or had nobody dared to deal with it so
+far? Anyway, I tried, and once again I was thoroughly convinced that it can't be
+that difficult.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200805_e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;In the quarry - &lt;br&gt;Discovering the path&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Moving blocks to the right place. Opening the door. Because
+of the breakable stones to the left: probably finding a hammer. Breaking the
+stones. Done. That's what I thought. Moving blocks somewhat worked, after a few
+tries I got it. Door opens. Hammer??&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Sure thing! Well embedded in a bunch of one-way-stones. And
+which of the blue lights is in charge? Believe me, you'll always choose the
+wrong one, guaranteed. The hammer-light's the other one. But never mind, it
+still works out well.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;So back again, knocking down stones. Lotsa stones. Did you
+unlock the door? Well done. Go on. A mini-labyrinth. Not much of a problem for
+experienced lab-runners.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Oh dear. A minefield. The original Oxyd manual says: bombs
+can be ignited by pushing stones over them. Great. If I'll move one of the
+blocks within here, the whole room will blow up. I thought as much.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;But these accursed bombs won't work this way, neither in the
+lower area, which really is a pleasure, nor in the upper area where it would
+come in quite handy. But first of all you have your brains, and secondly there's
+a fuse. After replaying the level for another time I finally got the bomb
+thing.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;A boulder. Well, well! I got it moving and listened. Listened
+to the sound of decline of the garden's pleasures, so to say. Restart. This time
+I was faster. Light up all oxyds within reach, then hurry on. Mirrors. Great. I
+like mirror levels. Supposing I can take my time. Which wasn't true in this
+case. I believe I had to restart the level for at least another 5 times before I
+finally lit up the last oxyd. It was fantastic. And once again I was being asked
+if everything's alright with me. Why can't this man understand, that I really
+get a lot of pleasure from solving such a fantastic level?!&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200805_h.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Industrial accident: &lt;br&gt;Hopefully the life insurance pays off!&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;By the way, I could achieve quite a decent score back then.
+This morning it took me even more time just to handle the blocks. After all it's
+all just a matter of practise.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Shoki&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;We enter another part of the garden. What's that? Finally: behind 
+some mound we actually catch sight of our &quot;flowers&quot;, pleasantly 
+lined up. Unfortunately there's no direct approach.
+Before we can get out of here, several of these idle bulldozers  
+must be started and driven to their points of destination. 
+(Who finds it difficult to do so, might want to get some practise
+with &quot;Boulder-Puzzle&quot; (IV - #8) by the same author.) If you're 
+getting bulldozed, it actually isn't that dramatic, if you've acted
+foresighted in the previous area. If not, one more time it's time 
+for Shift-F3. (Who would think of something like this the first time?
+Not me.) Eventually we've got our little repairs done here too.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Now we reach the last part of the labyrinth. The way, that leads
+to the &quot;flowers&quot;, seems to be obvious - too obvious? After a bit of
+wandering around we arrive at the last (Really the last? Somehow 
+I can't quite believe it.) obstacle: One of these bulldozers, 
+stopped by a stone, blocks our way. Behind it the first &quot;flowers&quot; and 
+a sign, that can't be deciphered from here. Well, let's get the 
+bulldozer going and roll away the stone. Wait a minute! Have a closer
+look to the right first. There's a whole company of bulldozers waiting
+for the order to go into action. Also there's a greenhouse light with a 
+switch nearby. What's going on?? It's not possible to get to the 
+other side and examine the region more closely. So let's see what 
+happens. ...&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200805_j.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;The giant clockwork - a detail&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Let's start work and push the stone aside. All right, the way's
+cleared. Now we can read what's written on the sign: &quot;Quickly!&quot; Oh no!
+stress of examinations close to the ending. But now that we've finally
+reached our &quot;flowers&quot;, we won't be that badly off. That's what you
+think! Count the &quot;flowers&quot; first! Didn't you notice the small passage 
+to the right? And did you forget about the greenhouse light and these 
+duff bulldozers? &quot;:-&gt;&quot; or &quot;.'P&quot; or even &quot;-/-&quot;, I'm never feeling too 
+good from this point on.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;So quickly off into the greenhouse to adjust everything so that this
+&quot;flower&quot; is provided with light as well. By the way, why has it actually
+been blocked up in this way? Perhaps it's no &quot;flower&quot; at all, but some 
+kind of plant which the gardener has reserved for himself? No, of course
+not what you're thinking of! ... However, we've got no time for such 
+things. Let's quickly pick all of the &quot;flowers&quot; within reach. One 
+remains, but as I said before, the gardener will collect it, when it
+has received enough light.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Actually the single tasks, you'll have to carry out in the 
+&quot;Pleasure Garden&quot;, aren't that difficult. But somehow the mass
+of problems is a problem. And the final countdown's really 
+pretty tough. I can't remember how often I messed things up in the
+greenhouse or picked the wrong &quot;flowers&quot; at the wrong time. Though I'm
+really not fond of levels which demand quickness (Sorry! Actually 
+I can't stand them), in my opinion the final part of &quot;Pleasure Garden&quot;
+in contrast to the other parts adds much to the pleasure of the level
+as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Definitely &quot;Pleasure Garden&quot; has taken its seat high up in my 
+private Top 10. Many thanks to Jacob Scott for this terrific level.&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;p&gt;We're particularly interested in articles about the following levels:
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Gods of Enigma II&quot; by moonpearl&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Industrial Puzzles&quot; by Raoul Bourquin&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Plan Ahead&quot; by Jacob Scott&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Block its way!&quot; by Jon 'WB' Sneyers&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Many thanks in advance, only your help can keep the LotM alive!&lt;/p&gt;
