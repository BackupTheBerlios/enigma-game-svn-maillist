+&lt;div class=&quot;lotm&quot;&gt;
+
+In our first independent level article, we want to talk about and look behind
+the curtains of &quot;Patterns of Impulse&quot; (IV/44). Have fun with a
+comment from Alain and one from the author!
+
+&lt;h2 class=&quot;lotm&quot;&gt;My level of the moment&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I recently came across &quot;Patterns of Impulse&quot;,
+which is not the kind of levels I like usually (not calm enough for me)
+but trying to solve it gave me a very good surprise, that I will try to
+explain here:
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+After having laughed at the show made by the impulse stones moving frantically
+(look also at &quot;Stay There!&quot; or &quot;Bendixxon&quot;, the last one
+witout impulse-stones), I suddenly
+discovered the mystical truth about this level:
+&lt;span style=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;It illustrates almost perfectly L. Boltzmann's kinetic
+theory of thermodynamics&lt;/span&gt;!
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Howzsat? Well, just imagine the impulse-stones are moving particles
+(the free path anyway is not much: less than one unit length, wiz the
+length of a cell in the landscape) which constitute an amorph solid at
+the beginning of the level: Nothing moves so that the initial
+temperature is the absolute zero. Then comes Blackball who caresses
+slightly one of the impulse stones, and suddenly everything explodes!
+This can be interpreted as the solid suddenly melting (the fluid is not
+compressible enough to be a gas, but rather a liquid) and if ever
+Blackball tries to swim into this liquid, a brownian motion crashes
+him, so he'd better stay in one of the shelters. Finally after some
+time (and some help from Blackball here and there) the fluid cools down
+and freezes again, keeping a cristallike structure (more on this later)
+and freeing a path (hopefully) to the oxyd stones &hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Usually, playing an Enigma level is being always active, and often
+rapid, which requires a lot of concentration and does not really let
+the player see what happens. But for this level, during the cooling of
+the fluid, one can observe several interesting phenomena:
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+When two impulse stones meet, say one moving to the right and the other
+to the left, they endure a shock like real particles, but the shock is
+perfectly elastic: After the shock, every one of the separating
+particles comes back to where it came, so that the total momentum is
+conserved. But if only one of the particles is moving, it gives its
+momentum to the other one, but instead of stopping, it comes back
+either: &lt;br&gt;
+The total momentum is doubled! We could call this a more-than-elastic
+shock. The &quot;worst&quot; case is when an impulse-stone hits the central
+stone of a group of three, which after the shock begin to move all of three,
+plus the initial moving stone, which comes back, so that the momentum
+is quadrupled!
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/articles/level_andreas11_a.png&quot;
+alt=&quot;cubic crystal&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+When the stones don't move anymore, they tend by themselves to be
+arranged in a regular pattern, which we may call a cristal, and looks
+typically like this.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I propose to call this crystal structure the
+cubic system because it looks like a cubic crystal viewed from above. In this
+crystal, the distance between two neighbours is twice the unit length. But there
+is a more compact, a rarer, crystal structure which is stable (temperature
+zero), which I compare to the diamond structure.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/articles/level_andreas11_b.png&quot;
+alt=&quot;diamond crystal&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+(one particle is
+missing on the lower line: impossible to move another here without touching one
+of the stones of the middle line, which would &hellip; arrgh!)
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+In this crystal
+structure, every particle has 4 neighbours like in the cubic structure,
+&nbsp;but the distance between neighbours is the square root of 2, times the
+unit length: About 70% of the preceding. Actually there is a still more compact
+stable structure, where the space is completely filled with impulse-stones, but
+to build it would require much more pressure than Blackball could furnish. In
+this structure that I would be tempted to call the &quot;neutron star
+structure&quot;, the 
+distance between neighbours is simply the unit length, then 70% of the diamond
+and half of the cubic structure.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+There is more to say about these
+structures: Imagine a row of impulse-stones in an otherwize empty terrain, each
+occupying a cell with odd abscissa: Cells 1, 3, 5, etc. Then along comes
+Blackball at position 0 who pushes impulse-stone at 1 to position 2: The
+impulse-stone excites the one at 3, who goes to 4 and sends it back to position
+1. Then&nbsp; the stone at 4 sends the one at 5 to 6, which makes it resume its
+equilibrium position at 3, etc.: What we see is the propagation of a pressure
+wave in this pattern, which I would call a phonon. I have also observed some
+kind of cavitation (bubbles of void moving in the fluid), and temperature
+fluctuation. One can even see the ice cristal grow in a still moving fluid, and
+sometimes partly melting. Also when two parts of the liquid freeze in
+incompatible cristal structure, a default appears in the cristal which can
+propagate in the solid &hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+All of this while waiting that the situation calms down!
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Thinking to the moving switches of &quot;How solid?&quot;, &quot;The Flagstone
+Reaper&quot; and &quot;The Dark Outside&quot; I begin to realize that Andreas
+has a dangerous gift to give life to strange 
+creatures (half-robot and half-alien) and observe their independant evolution,
+not unlike the hero from a Mary Shelley book &hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Brrr!
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Alain&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+The first version of &quot;Patterns of Impulse&quot; I still have on my hard
+drives dates back to May the 30th, 2005. In my internal nummeration, it was
+number 21, and hence a relatively late level, but first things first &hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+As a child, I played Oxyd 1 completely through. It was a great experience, and
+I think it formed my character in quite a way, as it taught me that patience
+and hard work really do pay off. But after I completed level 100, and didn't
+find anyone to play through the link games completely, I quickly
+forgot about Oxyd, as I didn't know about the follow-up games.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Years passed, so did the games I played. I switched from Windows to mainly
+Linux, when I started to study. And then, on some happy day in 2004 or
+2005, I found Enigma 0.81 through the linux distribution SuSE by random. It
+immediately caught my attention, and I started playing. But I was also curious,
+was it still in development? Many projects get abandonded over the years. Not
+so with Enigma. I quickly found version 0.92 on the internet, and as I wasn't
+able to compile it, I played it on Windows. But I wanted more&mdash;and looked at
+the level files. They seemed easy to understand, and the BlackBallEditor helped
+me to write some first simple experiments.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+The first one, my number 1, really was just an experiment. Number 2 already grew
+more interesting: It used reversed friction, like in the &quot;Nightmare&amp;quot
+series, but without death stones. It was one of those levels which solved
+themselfes. Then I got the idea to realise Lissajous curves in a level. Indeed,
+my first motivation was similar to what I later realised as
+&quot;Lissajous&quot;, but with a rotor instead of a moving death stone. As I
+wasn't good enough to program this, I simply copied some code from Nat's
+&quot;When Gravity Fails&quot; and created my first real level, which would
+later be called &quot;Lissajous' Revenge&quot; (yes, the revenge was first,
+I chose the titles later). What followed, were &quot;Spaceleast&quot;
+(6) and &quot;Spaceless&quot; (7), &quot;Laser Castle&quot; (8), &quot;Friend
+or Foe?&quot; (9), &quot;Laser Path&quot; (11), &quot;Robin's Wood&quot; (13),
+&quot;Tropical Island&quot; (14: Yes, &quot;Robin's Wood&quot; and
+&quot;Tropical Island&quot; both came from the same idea of realising some
+theme in Enigma), &quot;Turn Around&quot; (15),
+&quot;Lissajous&quot; (17, finally), &quot;Moure-Switches&quot; (19, I wanted
+to create a code-puzzle level) and lots of ideas, that never made it to mature
+levels. At some point I decided to write 16 levels to be published&mdash;16 being
+the square of my favourite number. This would be the first time for me to really
+publish something I programmed. Counting the levels above, we get 11.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Then came &quot;Patterns of Impulse&quot;, as number 21. I don't really know
+how this idea developped. It surely wasn't planned, and I think, I just played
+around a bit, putting some movable impulse stones together, randomly, but with
+some respect to symmetry, just to see how they would interact. I love
+(mathematically) chaotic behaviour, this was already the driving force for
+&quot;Laser Castle&quot;, and would later lead to &quot;Orbitting&quot; and
+&quot;Chess, Bugs &amp; Rock'n'Roll&quot;. Chaos has the fascinating habit of
+creating order out of itself, order of a more primordial kind than what we
+normally understand about this concept. Patterns emerge from chaos&mdash;and
+exactly this was what happened with the impulse stones. It was fascinating. 
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+By the way, I dug up the first version of &quot;Pattern of Impulse&quot; and
+dressed it for Enigma 1.01. You can download it &lt;a
+href=&quot;<A HREF="http://download.berlios.de/enigma-game/andreas11_a.xml">http://download.berlios.de/enigma-game/andreas11_a.xml</A>&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+There already were oxyd stones, I had put some into the edges of the level. At
+first, they just were there to appease BlackBallEd, which wouldn't let me save
+the level without setting oxyd stones. But then I tried to reach the oxyds
+through the evolving chaos. And failed. After watching the moving impulse
+stones, it became an interesting challenge to open the oxyd stones as well.
+Though I noticed, that the level wasn't perfect yet. It needed some control,
+just a little bit. I wanted to force the gamer to control the chaos, to keep it
+quiet. A good dexterity-player would open the stones just by sneaking through
+the ubiquitous chaos&mdash;that wasn't what I saw to be the more interesting
+challenge.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+So I removed four of the impulse stones (chosen to meet the design), and added
+the doors to shut the oxyds by adding triggers and stones in the (invisible)
+screens above and below. I used this technique before, in &quot;Laser
+Castle&quot;, and combined it here with timer stones to make sure that the
+doors would wait a moment before opening the way to the oxyds again. It worked
+out well. I thought about a title. I wanted to point out at the patterns
+visible in the activated level. At that time I read about a show in the Star
+Trek series called &quot;Patterns of Force&quot;, which I never saw, and which
+is considered one of the worst Star Trek shows ever; but I stuck to the title.
+I quickly settled with &quot;Patterns of Impulse&quot; perfectly describing the
+level, as I think.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I added an easy mode and on July 1st, 2005, I send &quot;Patterns of
+Impulse&quot; and 15 other levels  to the devel mailing list, with the good
+feeling that work has been done and now I'd be through with Enigma and could go
+on with other things. If it wasn't for this persistent discussion about ratings
+&hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
