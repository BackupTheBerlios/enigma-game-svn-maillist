+Step 2c Deal with an idiosynchratic package
 
-Add the following sections to each of the port files above, with the
-exceptions listed below. Some of this may be unnecessary overkill, but
-it does seem to work. NOTE: When editing the Portfiles also remove any
-dependency delcaration for port:zlib.
+The build environment for Enigma will require installing libtool in
+Macports. That package has a listed build dependency on automake which
+in turn has dependencies that bring in all of perl and other large
+packages. MacOS 10.5 has a sufficiently current automake, so the
+dependency can simply be removed before installing libtool. Edit the
+Portfile for libtool using the following command, substituting your
+favorite editor for nano if you don't want the default vim or whatever
+is specified in the EDITOR environment variable:
 
-platform darwin 8 {
-	 configure.env-append    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
-	 build.env-append        MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4

-}
+ sudo port edit --editor nano libtool
 
-   --------
-Exceptions:
+and remove the line that specifies a build dependency on
+automake. This step is not necessary if you already have perl5
+installed in MacPorts, as it is just to let you avoid that
+installation. Then install it with the following option:
 
-pkgconfig does not have to be altered, as it is only a build dependency
-tiff does not have to be altered, as it is already configured properly
+ sudo port install libtool -universal
 
-libsdl already has a darwin_8 section, so add the above
-contents to the end of the existing section.
+NOTE: If you ever do a port sync or port selfupgrade on this
+installation it will wipe out this change, so you would have to edit
+it again before doing a port upgrade to avoid downloading and
+installing automake and the large packages it requires.
 
-xercesc needs the following section instead of the above:
+Step 2d. Fix the xercesc package
 
-platform darwin 8 {
-	 configure.env-append    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
-	 build.env-append        MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4

+Edit the portfile of the xercesc package using the command
+
+ sudo port edit --editor nano xercesc
+
+and after the closing bracket of the darwin 8 section insert the
+following section if on an Intel Mac, or the second one if on a PPC
+
+platform universal {
+	configure.env-append    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
+	build.env-append        MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4

+		-l -Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
 }
 
-   --------
 
-Uninstall and clean each of the above packages if they are installed
-in MacPorts, then edit the Portfile for each one, then install all of
-them with variant +darwin_8. The following commands will get all of the
-required packages once dependencies are followed:
+platform universal {
+	configure.env-append    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3
+	build.env-append        MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3
+	configure.pre_args-append	-c /usr/bin/gcc-4.0 -x /usr/bin/g++-4.0 \

+		-l -isysroot -l /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk -l -mmacosx-version-min=10.3 \
+		-l -Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk

- sudo port install libsdl +darwin_8
- sudo port install libsdl_image +darwin_8

- sudo port install libsdl_mixer +darwin_8
+NOTE: If you ever do a port sync or port selfupgrade on this
+installation it will wipe out this change, so you would have to edit
+it again before doing a port upgrade to ensure it builds properly.

-Creating a universal binary with support for 10.3.9+
----------------------------
+Step 5. (optional) Creating a universal binary with support for 10.3.9+
 
 To get a Universal binary, you must create separate builds on a PPC
 and an Intel Mac, then combine them to form one Universal
 build. Follow the instructions above to get a build for 10.4+ on the
-Intel machine. Modify the instructions above on the PPC machine as
-follows to get a build that will work on 10.3.9 or higher:
+Intel machine and for 10.3.9+ on the PPC machine.
 
-Instead of adding a &quot;platform darwin 8&quot; section to the MacPorts
-Portfiles, add an equivalent &quot;platform darwin 7&quot; section in which each
-&quot;10.4&quot; is replaced by &quot;10.3&quot; and each &quot;MacOSX10.4u.sdk&quot; is replaced by
-&quot;MacOSX10.3.9.sdk&quot;. In the steps to install the MacPorts packages, use
-+darwin_7 in the install commands instead of +darwin_8
-
-If you then complete the bulld process on the PPC machine it will
-produce a PPC-only build compatible with MacOS 10.3.9 and higher.

-
-The remainder of this file is being kept to document the procedures
-that were used with older versions of MacOS X, but we have not tested
-them using current versions of Enigma.
-
-Building under MacOS 10.4:
--------------------------
-
-The easiest way to install what you need under MacOS 10.4 is to use
-the Fink environment and use it to install SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image,
-SDL_ttf, and Xerces-c. DarwinPorts provides a similar environment and
-set of packages as Fink, but as of this writing we have not tried it
-for building Enigma. Neither have we tried the older version of Fink
-that runs on 10.3.9.
-
-As of this writing, xerces-c is only in the unstable package tree of
-fink. The fink FAQ describes how to temporarily switch to using
-unstable so that you can install a package from there even though you
-are in general using the stable tree.
-
-The Fink install of Xerces-c does not build the static library
-libxerces-c.a so the following additional steps are necessary.
-
-1. If you have not yet installed xerces-c, install it and some
-associated packages using the -k option to keep the build directories
-for a later step:
- 
-  fink -k install xerces-c xerces-c-dev xerces-c-shlibs
-
-If you already installed them, rebuild the using the -k option
-
-  fink -k rebuild xerces-c xerces-c-dev xerces-c-shlibs
-
-2. The xerces-c source tree can now be found under /sw/src/fink.build/
-in a directory that corresponds to the version of xerces that you
-installed. cd to it and set the XERCESCROOT environment variable as in
-the following example:
-
-  cd /sw/src/fink.build/ xerces-c-2.7.0-1002/xerces-c-src_2_7_0
-  export XERCESCROOT=`pwd`
-
-Put the following in an executable file in the
-$XERCESCROOT/src/xercesc directory, cd to that directory and run it,
-using sudo if fink is configured to always build as root.
-
-   #!/bin/sh
-   make -n XML_LIB_DIR=$XERCESCROOT/lib/dummy |
-     grep 'c++ .*\.dylib' |
-     tr \  \\n |
-     grep '\.o$' |
-     ( cd ../../obj ; xargs ar rcs $XERCESCROOT/lib/libxerces-c.a )
-   
-Then 
-
-    sudo cp $XERCESCROOT/lib/libxerces-c.a /sw/lib/
-    sudo ranlib /sw/lib/libxerces-c.a
-
-If you do use Fink or DarwinPorts, as long as the required additional
-libraries are consistently placed in the same directory, e.g.,
-/usr/fink/lib, then the Enigma build scripts should work. There will
-be a problem if you install, for example, SDL in /usr/fink/lib and
-Xerces-c in /usr/local/lib.
-
-Once the Fink packages are installed, follow step 7 below to build
-Enigma.
-
-Building under 10.3.9, or under 10.4 without Fink:
---------------------------------------------------
-
-Here are steps I used to build Enigma under MacOS 10.3.9 that already
-had X-11 installed (I use OpenOffice, so whatever that needs was there
-already), using svn trunk. I can't say for sure if having X-11 installed
-made any difference. I mention it in case that is a necessary prerequisite.
-
-1. Very important for building a number of unix projects in 10.3.9 is
-   to downgrade QuickTime 7.0.4 to version 7.0.1 using
-   <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime701reinstallerforquicktime704.html">http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime701reinstallerforquicktime704.html</A>
-
-   The QuickTime 7.0.4 upgrade was pushed out as part of a 10.3.9
-   software update. It installs a version of libstdc++ that was built
-   with a newer version of gcc than the 3.3 that ships with MacOS
-   10.3.9, resulting in various linker errors when trying to build
-   many projects ported from unix that used to build fine. The
-   downgrade fixes that.
-   
-   The downgrade is not necessary to build in MacOS 10.4.
-
-   If you continue to get mysterious linker errors under 10.3.9 you
-   can also try reinstalling xcode 1.5. Some people said it restored
-   some files messed up by a software update. I tried it at one point
-   earlier before I found out about the QuickTime problem and it
-   didn't by itself help, so I can't say for sure if it that really is
-   also necessary.
-
-2. I earlier installed, for some other projects, gettext, freetype,
-   and libpng, so I can't say for sure if any of the other required
-   libraries requires one or more of them. If you see errors about
-   anything like that missing when you try the next steps, download the
-   source of whichever you need from its project web site, and use
-     ./configure ; make ; sudo make install
-
-3. (10.3.9 only) Download latest versions of autoconf (2.59) and automake
-   (1.9.6). The versions included in 10.3.9 are too old. Build and install
-   them from sources using
-     ./configure ; make ; sudo make install 
-
-4. Install binary packages of SDL, SDL-devel, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, and
-   SDL_ttf, available from <A HREF="http://libsdl.org">http://libsdl.org</A> in the links under
-   Download. I used SDL 1.2, the current stable build at the time,
-   downloading <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.9.dmg">http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.9.dmg</A> and
-   <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.9.pkg.tar.gz">http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.9.pkg.tar.gz</A> and found
-   the other packages at the Libraries link under Downloads:
-
-   <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer">http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer</A>
-   <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image">http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image</A>
-   <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf">http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf</A>
-
-   In each case download both the source and the MacOSX binary
-   package. For this step install the binary packages into the
-   /Library directory (which is the default).
-
-5. Download the source tarballs (see previous step) of SDL, SDL_mixer,
-   SDL_image, and SDL_ttf. Unpack them somewhere convenient, then
-   build and install each of them, starting with SDL.
-
-   All of them installed fine using
-     ./configure ; make ; sudo make install
-
-6. Download the source tarball of xerces-c from
-      <A HREF="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/</A>
-   I got version 2.7.0 and unpacked it in /usr/local/src. Change
-   references to those in the following commands to match your
-   circumstances:
-
-   export XERCESCROOT=/usr/local/src/xerces-c-src_2_7_0
-   cd /usr/local/src/xerces-c-src_2_7_0/src/xercesc
-   ./configure
-   make
-   sudo make install
-
-6(a) Then I had to do the following important step, which create a
-   static link library, as the MacOSX version of the xerces-c 2.7
-   build does not do that. Put the following in an executable file
-   in the $XERCESCROOT/src/xercesc directory, cd to that directory
-   and run it.
-
-   #!/bin/sh
-   make -n XML_LIB_DIR=$XERCESCROOT/lib/dummy |
-     grep 'c++ .*\.dylib' |
-     tr \  \\n |
-     grep '\.o$' |
-     ( cd ../../obj ; xargs ar rcs $XERCESCROOT/lib/libxerces-c.a )
-   
-  Then
-
-    sudo cp $XERCESCROOT/lib/libxerces-c.a /usr/local/lib/
-    sudo ranlib /usr/local/lib/libxerces-c.a
-
-7. Once all the above are all installed, build a Mac
-   application bundle from the command line by cd to the root directory of
-   the Enigma source tree (i.e., the directory above src) and running the
-   commands:
-
-     ./autogen.sh
-     ./configure
-     make
-     make macapp
-
-  The first line is only necessary if you are starting from the svn
-  sources. If you downloaded a release tarball, it should already have
-  had autogen.sh run and you can start with ./configure.
-
-  The final line builds a Mac OS X application bundle called
-  Enigma.app and a compressed disk image containing it called
-  enigma.dmg, both in the etc/ directory under the source tree root.
-
- You should be able to copy the enigma.dmg file to a Mac running
- 10.3.9 that has not had the various libraries required for building
- Enigma installed, open the disk image, and drop the Enigma app into
- any disk folder, e.g., Applications, to install Enigma.
-
-I have tested this only by building under 10.3.9 and running on
-10.3.9. Someone should update this file once they have tried building
-on 10.4 and tested the resulting application on both 10.3.9 and 10.4.
