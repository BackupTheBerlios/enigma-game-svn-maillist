+Hi, little ball. I see you've changed a lot. You look tired and worn out, your
+once black and shiny surface is dusty and scratched. But I do recognize you.
+I've seen you. You've been to a lot of places. You've explored the most remote
+corners of the multiple worlds of Enigma a countless number of times. You've
+explored simple one-screeners and walked on the grounds of the most vast and
+'Elaborate' worlds. You've wandered in the magnificent rooms of the fabulous
+Temple of Gold and strayed into dusty, gloomy long abandoned places, where
+virtually every step could be your last one. 
+&lt;/p&gt;

+    &lt;col width=&quot;160&quot;&gt;
+&lt;/colgroup&gt;
+&lt;/table&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+You flew through abysses protected by nothing but an umbrella and carefully
+stepped on slippery sheets of ice. You've walked among the thieves of Enigma,
+miserable creatures whose only desire in their life is to rob someone of his
+items, even the most unnecessary ones, and among the bones of the long dead
+adventurers who now want nothing else but to increase their numbers and will
+snatch anyone who comes near them. 
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+You've been a Sisyphus who struggled to carry the unconscious body of your
+fellow traveler on the steepest slopes and a Zeus who tried to drive your
+companion to the oxyds, frightening him with lightnings from a magic box you had
+found somewhere on your travels (a good friend you are). 
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+But now you have gone TOO FAR. You have ventured into the very heart of Enigma,
+into the place no mortal (or immortal, for that matter) is allowed even to
+approach. You have come to the place where the old gods of Enigma dwell, the
+supreme beings who created the Universe of Enigma millions of years ago and now
+rule all of its worlds. As half forgotten legends say, once there was a time
+when they walked on the grounds of the multiple worlds of Enigma, and any marble
+could seek their advice and protection. But even if there is a grain of truth in
+those old tales, those times are long gone. Long ago they left the worlds of
+Enigma, offended by the marbles who misused their good disposition, and now they
+rule Enigma, unseen to mortal marbles. 
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Their names were long forgotten, and their very existence is doubted by some
+marble heretics (1), but they do exist. They dwell in their own world that no
+marble is allowed to approach, and from this world they silently rule the
+universe of Enigma and the fate of all marbles. And most of all, they guard
+their precious Oxyds, the fathers of all Oxyds, the ideas of Oxyds, that gave
+birth to all the other oxyds in the multiple worlds of Enigma. Many courageous
+marbles have embarked on a journey, dreaming of stealing them, but none has ever
+come back. None, except you.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Yes, I remember you venturing here once. The gods
+wreaked their wrath on you, using against you the power of the Four Elements of
+Enigma, but then, impressed by your courage, dexterity and intelligence, they
+allowed you to leave unscathed.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200807_e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Strange colours, weird shapes&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+But you didn't learn this lesson and came here
+once more. Remember, their kindness is not infinite. This time they won't leave
+you alive.  You find yourself in a dark and gloomy place with strange shapes and
+colours. You realize at once that those shapes and colours were not meant for
+the eyes of mortal marbles. Slowly you regain your consciousness. You step
+carefully. Every step here could send you falling into the infinite abyss of the
+world of the gods of Enigma. As if to mock you, the gods left around hints for
+you, as well as extralives. As if they were sure that you won't be able to leave
+this place even with such help. Slowly, you move to the first entrance and then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+What kind of place is this? It doesn't look so gloomy around anymore. You look
+around one more time. Yes, there are no fatal abysses here. The bright walls
+around you somehow make you feel secure, and the sand under you surface crunches
+cheerfully. You remember these walls and this sand. You remember this sound.
+That's how the sand was crunching on those long nights when you walked on the
+beach with your friend Anna Whiteball, and the walls here are the walls of her
+nice tidy little house. Anna&hellip; Where is she now? Is she thinking of him? For some
+moments you allow your thoughts, so sad and so pleasant, to take control over
+you. Have the gods of Enigma and their laughter, that made you feel as if icy
+fingers are touching your heart, been just a dream? Is this Anna's house? Have
+you simply fallen asleep here? 
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200807_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Have the gods taken this place from my memory&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+But the document in your inventory shatters all those pleasant thoughts. No, you
+are still in the world of the gods of Enigma, and now you have to find their
+bloody hammer. Carefully, you count the dynamite sticks at your disposal. You
+have to use them with care. Just one dynamite stick put at the wrong place, and
+you are stuck forever in this room, without any hope to find the Holy Hammer
+anymore. But at last you do it! You find the Holy Hammer that, if the old
+legends were true, still remembers being held by Jacob the Builder, who used it
+to create more worlds than a marble can count. Hurriedly, you break the
+remaining walls, snatch the Holy Oxyd, and run back to the place where you found
+the Hammer. And then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Again you are in the same weird place. You feel that your inventory has somehow
+become rather heavy. The Hammer! You run to the wall and break it. Behind it you
+find another passage&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200807_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Nobody seems to have&lt;br&gt; been here for ages&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Oh, what a depressing place! You thought that there cannot be a nastier place
+than the one you just came from, but this&hellip; It looks like no one has stepped on
+this ground for millions of years. This place is so cold&hellip; So empty&hellip;  So
+desolate&hellip; The bridges between the platforms here are so old and insecure that
+you wouldn't dare to cross them more than once, and even that fills your sole
+with unease. Thankfully, there are some old rotten wooden blocks here. They will
+allow you to build new bridges, even if they are just a little more secure than
+the old ones are. But there are too few of them, so you have to be careful. You
+move one of them to the abyss, then another, and then&hellip; What's this?! Try one
+more time!!!!!!! Did you really hear a mad inhuman laughter or are you
+hallucinating? You know what has to be done. You have done it many times, though
+you never really liked it. You take an extralife from your inventory and then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Again this very place&hellip; Now you have to plan everything even more carefully. It
+seems like an eternity had passed until you found out how to get to the seed,
+carefully checking that there are no mistakes in your plan, and then&hellip; One block
+to the abyss, then another, then another, until finally&hellip; So, this is the very
+famous Holy Seed from which all other seeds and blocks have come? It looks like
+any other seed you've seen on your long journeys. But you don't pause to think
+it over. Hastily you snatch the Oxyd and then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Again you are in the same weird place where the entrances to the rooms which
+hold the Four Holy Items are. You grow a block to make your way to the third
+entrance, and then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200807_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;I can fly, my frie-e-ends&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+It's so cold here. But unlike the previous place, the frosty air here is somehow
+refreshing. It's like a clear cold night somewhere in the mountains. You find
+yourself on a white shiny platform. Around you can't see anything but similar
+platforms. The fresh night air and the calm shining of the platforms fill your
+soul with tranquility. Your way lies to the Holy Spring that, according to the
+legends, the gods used to look at the newly created worlds from above. You
+slowly breath in and&hellip; W-z-h-h-h-h&hellip;  One platform. W-z-h-h-h-h&hellip;  Another one.
+W-z-h-h-h-h&hellip;  One more&hellip; Here it is! The fabled Spring! You jump a few more
+times, snatch the Holy Oxyd, return to the place where you found the Spring and
+then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Again this weird place. But this time you see something new. What is it? Oh, no!
+ANNA! She lies unconscious on the other side of the abyss behind a wall of
+blocks. You need to talk to her. But how can you do this? You need the last Holy
+Item. You jump one more time and then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip; 
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Have the gods borrowed this beach from your memory? Anna and you&hellip; But there's no
+time for pleasant memories. You have to find the Holy Ying Yang Symbol that
+would allow you to talk to her at a distance. You make a step and then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Ouch!
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+What's this? You find yourself in that dark weird place again, and there's one
+extralife less in your inventory. You jump again and then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200807_a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Fighting the dead&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+The beach again. But now you are careful. You realize that the gods set the
+bones of the adventurers of the past who came here to steal their Oxyds to guard
+this place, and far away you see their ghosts barring your way to the Ying Yang
+symbol. You need two items, one to see the bones under the sand, and the other
+to fight the ghostly warriors. You don't have them, but luckily there's a laser
+here, and there's no one in the world of marbles better at transformation than
+you. Carefully you move to the Oxyd, trying not to touch the bones, then to the
+line of warriors. A few movements with a sword and the way to the Holy Ying Yang
+is free. Then&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Down, down, down&hellip; 
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Again the Place of Entrances&hellip; You take the Ying Yang symbol and whisper, &quot;Anna!
+Anna! Can you hear me?&quot; A slight movement at a distance&hellip; &quot;Anna! Please, touch
+one of the blocks, so that I could get past them.&quot; A slight movement again, and
+one of the blocks suddenly turns black. The way is free! Never taking your eyes
+off Anna, you jump and&hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+
+&lt;h4&gt;The idea came to me while playing Hexen II&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;i&gt;
+We're very happy that we were finally able to get in contact with moonpearl
+again, and obviously she was quite happy as well &hellip;&lt;/i&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Gotta write a word, now. I can do it. Despite my fingertips trembling over
+the keyboard, I can do it. Gotta talk about the making of &quot;Four Elemental
+Tests&quot; (or &quot;Gods of Enigma&quot;, or whatever you like to name it). I
+don't know what to say. I don't know where to start. So I guess I should start
+from the beginning.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I was no more than 7 or 8 years old when I took my first steps into the
+world of Oxyd. I remember hurrying to finish hard landscapes because I had
+to go to school. I remember being stuck at the 11th landscape for ages,
+before I was offered the Oxyd book for my ninth birthday. I remember crying
+and bashing the old Atari's dusty mouse when I made a wrong step.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I am now 22, and I've been through all Oxyd. I solved that damned 100th
+landscape at the age of 16, under the eyes of my German penpal. I've been
+through nearly all Oxyd magnum! as well&mdash;never solved the last landscape.
+:( I've also given a try to Per.Oxyd and Oxyd Extra!, though I liked the two
+of them less than the previous titles&mdash;although the graphics were enhanced,
+they cruelly lacked the colors which made the world of Oxyd bright and
+wonderful.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I thought it was the end of the adventure. I thought I had seen it all and I
+would never get to share my passion of Oxyd with other people. And then I
+found Enigma. I don't remember exactly how it happened, but I definitely
+recall the sparkles in my eyes at that time. I was thrilled to see such a
+perfect adaptation, which totally preserved the spirit of my old pal Oxyd.
+So, first, I would like to thank Enigma's developers deeply, for not only
+giving me the occasion to contribute (modestly) to their work, but also to
+return to my childhood's favourite hobby.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+To my further delight, a level editor was featured with the game. It was a
+real opportunity for me to give shape to the Oxyd landscapes I used to draw
+in my old exercise-books&mdash;normal children draw people and houses and
+flowers, but I preferred Oxyd landscapes. ;) And so did I. I used
+BlackBallEd to write a bunch of landscapes, most of which look too &quot;mundane&quot;
+to me. I mean by that, most ideas have already been used in former
+landscapes, and it's really hard to come up with something brand new.
+However, I was determined to find a both fun and atypic concept. I gave much
+thought to what a friend of mine once said: &quot;How can you identify yourself
+as a marble? What is your reason to be, your goal in life, aside from
+solving puzzles?&quot;. And that's how I started to make up some kind of
+storyline where the player would get to embody the saviour of a world ruined
+by evil deities, thus travelling through wrecked landscapes with lots of
+cracks, falls and breakable stones&hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+The very idea of the Four Elemental Tests came to me while playing Hexen II
+&mdash;yes, play up to the third episode, and you'll see. ;) I meant to build a
+landscape which would require all of the player's skills to solve&mdash;that is
+to say, swiftness, intelligence, dexterity and patience. Each of the four
+tests is mildly difficult, but the real challenge lies in succeding in all of
+them at once. To be honest I tried the landscape many times to make sure it
+was possible, but I've been through it only a very few times. So I thought
+it would be fine for the rest of the community, who seemed to enjoy very
+challenging landscapes. ;)
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I don't know how I came to write a second episode, but I do remember that I
+wanted to try something different. While the first one was merely a linear
+adventure, I wanted to make for the second one four separate quests to
+&quot;unlock&quot; the path in the very first screen. I also decided to change the
+content of the tests, but I had to keep them in association with their
+respective elements. What I'm quite proud of is that I've managed to stick
+to the four elements, while mixing the tests&mdash;thus, the Fire Quest includes
+intelligence, the Earth Quest dexterity&hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+That was three years ago. And a few days ago I found an e-mail from Harry
+among all the spam in my mailbox. :s At first I thought it was a joke. How
+could an old landscape of mine be voted level of the month? Then Harry
+pointed out that my work had also been awarded 2007's best level series.
+And, well&hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+IT'S JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME!!!
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+;)
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+No, seriously, I haven't won an Oscar yet, but it means very much to me to
+be praised as a level designer. The little girl moving the mouse carefully
+with her right hand, while sucking her left thumb, has grown into someone
+with the power to create. Maybe it's the reason why I made a landscape
+requiring all the talents at once to defy the gods&hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Anyway, I'll finish this (long) article with good news for my fan club. ;)
+Indeed, the &quot;Four Elemental Tests&quot; are not an isolated work. The two
+landscapes were actually designed as steps of a whole trip through four
+realms&mdash;each associated with an element, as you can guess. I intended to
+make several &quot;Four Elemental Tests&quot;, which would appear at regular
+intervals, just like meditation landscapes. A few other landscapes of the
+series are already available, and all of your positive feedback gives me the
+urge to work on it again. Hopefully, I can design as much as possible of the
+series until the end of year. I'll try to keep in touch and give news this
+summer.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Thanks for reading my article.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Thanks for playing my landscapes.
+&lt;/div&gt;

+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;i&gt;moonpearl, thanks for creating them for us. And your idea to embed the level
+into a full storyline has since been used by many other authors as well, with
+resounding success, like in the case of &quot;The Aztec Temple&quot; and lots of
+levels in our next release of Enigma. We all look forward to your next levels!

+They say that the abysses in the world of gods are
+infinite, and you can be falling into one for a million years without seeing the
+bottom. You've always wondered if it's true. Now you'll be able to find it out!

+(1) According to an apocrypha found by the legendary adventurer called
+Moneymaker under a chameleon stone when he was exploring an unintended shortcut,
+the names of at least some of those gods were Daniel, Andreas, Ronald and Raoul.
+But the authenticity of that document is still being widely disputed in the
+learned marble circles.
