 Down, down, down&hellip;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 
+&lt;h4&gt;&quot;Back to the starting room&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Actually the level starts off quite harmlessly, a path with just one
+possible exit. Alright, nothing ventured nothing gained. Let's get going
+then, down along this oneway-street.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Room 1: Many dynamites and many breakable stones. It can't be that
+difficult&hellip; Boom, boom, boom&hellip; Hmm&hellip; No, it doesn't seem to work this
+way&hellip; So it's first top and then bottom, or what else?&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Finally I've got the hammer and plunge into the hole in the ground. Back
+again at the starting point. Fortunately a second possibility to exit
+this room presents itself to me, and luckily the oxydstones seem to have
+been arranged in pairs.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Room 2: Oh dear!&hellip; Many cracked floors, but also enough wooden stones
+to build bridges. Really enough? Well, if only I could keep from always
+choosing the wrong way or falling down into the abyss, there should be enough
+of them. But thanks to the Gods, there's this one seed, which might
+serve as a substitute (or should it be used somewhere else?).&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Back to the starting room I came to realize that my second guess had
+been the right one&hellip;&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Room 3: Oh Gods, have mercy! I really hate this spring-hopping-across-the-abyss, 
+especially on slippery floors. Either I'm too fast and overshoot the mark, 
+or I'm too slow. How good to have some extra-lifes available about this time. 
+I was in urgent need of them.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Back to the starting room. Now it's about time to bring up the white
+marble. A yin-yang would come in handy now&hellip;&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Room 4: Ah, there it is! And some easy challenge at last. The knights
+don't impress me much, I've got the hammer and there's a laser nearby.
+Great!&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Errr!?&hellip; I've died! Why? Ah, invisible death-stones, how mean! If only
+I had some glasses. But there was some way to make them of your own
+accord, wasn't it?&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Finally I've reached the goal, conquered the yin-yang and opened up all
+oxyds.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;All in all an excellent level, which consists of all the things, that
+make Enigma such an exciting game (at least to me): strategy, dexterity
+- and the possibility to transform objects.&lt;/div&gt;

 What kind of place is this? It doesn't look so gloomy around anymore. You look
 around one more time. Yes, there are no fatal abysses here. The bright walls
 around you somehow make you feel secure, and the sand under you surface crunches

+&lt;h4&gt;It produces an attraction that I can not resist&mdash;I even don't want to.&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;When I got to the third room for the first time I thought: &quot;Oh no!&quot;. To
+me this damned &quot;hopping&quot; is a horrible thing. Usually that means: solve
+the level once, then leave for good. It really took me quite some
+attempts to finally reach the fourth room with my last ball and then &hellip;&lt;/div&gt; 
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You know what happens then. Well, some attempts later I succeeded in
+solving the level at last. As I said before usually it's &quot;Once is
+enough!&quot; for me in such cases. Yet what does &quot;usually&quot; mean? Somehow
+something attracted me to challenge the Gods over and over again. By the
+way, I never had to regret it, and I enjoyed it with increasing enthusiasm.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;What was and what is the reason for me, to play (and keep on playing)
+&quot;Gods of Enigma II&quot; again and again? First, there's the procedure how to
+play it: it's linear, but always brings you back to the starting point.
+And secondly, there's the contrast between the different rooms,
+concerning both the visual and the technical aspects. In my opinion the
+combination of these two aspects produces an attraction that I can not
+resist&mdash;I even don't want to.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;However, the third room isn't my favourite one (it will probably
+never be), but it isn't that naaaasty anymore as it seemed to me the
+first time.  :-)&lt;/div&gt;

 Again this weird place. But this time you see something new. What is it? Oh, no!
 ANNA! She lies unconscious on the other side of the abyss behind a wall of
 blocks. You need to talk to her. But how can you do this? You need the last Holy
