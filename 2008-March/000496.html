+&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; by Sven Siggelkow
+&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Dear visitor, please be quiet as we now enter Enigma's asylum. As you
+certainly know, the modern lunatic of today carries not only a split
+personality, but a Cantor set of identities. Our Level of the Month March
+respects this quiet good. As you see, each of our four buildings is itself
+split into two separated cells for our guests. Don't worry, most of them are
+quiet harmless, phlegmatic inhabitants of our institution. Just take care, that
+you don't end here as a psycho as well, when you try to push them to their
+beds; welcome to &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;/table&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Not much has changed during the last month in the user ratings; indeed, all
+ratings were stable, with &quot;Island Labyrinth&quot; and
+&quot;Quadropolis&quot; jointly leading the list. &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;
+enters at position 11, just behind &quot;Big Adventures&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;&quot;It took Tarim back to his student days&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Yes, our stones in Enigma have a pretty hard time. Being pushed around by
+careless marbles, falling forever into dark abysses, having to hide objects the
+marble is desperately searching for, going postal already as a young seed, or
+floating forever in cold water &hellip; and whenever something goes wrong, it's
+their fault. And although most stones tolerate this treatment in their own stoic
+way, in &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;, Sven Siggelkow took care of those stones,
+who just couldn't take it anymore.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; is Sven Siggelkow's beautifully designed study in
+compressed perplexity.  Eight tiny Sokoban style puzzles, and each one
+impossible, no matter how you look at it&mdash;until, finally, that moment of
+inspiration dawns.  It took Tarim back to his student days.  Moving home
+involved shifting all his furniture into a spatially-challenged room and then
+re-arranging it while all the time leaving space to stand in.  And, when he was
+finally finished, still being able to get out of the door to go to the pub.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Not being fleet-of-mouse, Tarim didn't even think of racing to follow the
+boulder into TopLeftOne from the switch.  There had to be another way &hellip; 
+The wand in TopLeftTwo must be the answer!  But getting that involved solving
+TopLeftOne&mdash;unless Tarim could extricate a couple of wood blocks from
+TopRightTwo and sneak across the flooded back-door of TopLeftTwo.  Such was the
+power of this level in making Tarim believe the impossible could be made
+possible&mdash;this was the way he eventually solved it &hellip;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Tarim&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;If you hurry up, you can see the warden entering the first cell of our
+complex. Two guards secure the cell while the warden is inside. The three
+inmates of this cell suffer from amnesia from being hit too hard, and always
+forget where their beds are. In the cell on the right, we have three
+cleptomaniacs, who had to hide objects below them in some unnamed nightmarishly
+level. Please be careful, you never know what items they might have brought
+here. Last time they managed to hide a snowman in their cell, which consequently
+melted &hellip; please take care not to slip on the wet floor.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;&quot;'Psycho Pushing' got one of my favorite levels&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The next cell is inhabited by some compulsive gamblers on detox. Oh, they are
+nice fellows, they worked as turnstiles some months ago. Bring along something
+round for them to play, and you'll be welcome. And take care not to run into the
+other warden. The inmates of the next cell however, are pyromaniacs, former
+walls, that had to stand near explosives for too long. Let's hope they did not
+mix those cleaning agents again &hellip; they always try to escape this way.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200803_b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Oops &hellip;&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+No other level did cause such contradicting phases of emotions on me than
+&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; in the years I know this level.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+First I became simply frustrated by this level as I was not fast enough with my
+marble to enter the upper left puzzle before the seeds close the gate. I did saw
+all these challenging nice sokoban like puzzles, but I had to go back improving
+my skills on the many other levels that I still had to solve.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+After quite a time I returned to this level. Now I had no major problem entering
+the puzzles and I really enjoyed them. &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; got one of my
+favorite levels.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+But then I discovered that you can shortcut some of the puzzles. I really got
+disappointed. All these nice puzzles and you must circumvent some of them to get
+a low score? I thought that the shortcuts have to be fixed.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200803_d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;BANG, BOOM, BANG!&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+But with the time I found more and more shortcuts. I started wondering if they
+were an intended alternative solution. Detecting and thinking about how to
+combine the shortcuts became a challenge of its own. Looking at my world record
+score in easy mode you may imagine that I did not solve many of the 8 mini
+sokobans by pushing. Can you guess how many? - Just one and a half! A half? Yes,
+as I do not have the need to push all stones onto the triggers I need a just
+fraction of time.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Finally Sven did fix the shortcuts after admitting that they are quite
+interesting. So if you like to investigate this unplanned alternatives do it at
+once. You will likely be much faster than me in pushing and rushing through the
+puzzles! But nevertheless I am looking forward to the fixed version.
+Congratulations and thanks to Sven for this challenging level.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Ronald Lamprecht&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The inmates of the first cell on the Southern side of our asylum must keep
+locked in, as they suffer from dementia. They once were boulder stones, and
+still tend to wander around, until they suddenly get astray and don't know where
+they are. Thus we better keep them in their cells, so they don't get into
+troubles. Which happens quite easily, their neighbors being overly aggressive
+Borderline personalities, former knight stones that have been defeated. Please
+be very careful when you speak to them, one step into the wrong direction and
+their impulsive emotions and actions might injure you.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;&quot;'Psycho Pushing' resulted from studying the old Oxyd levels again&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The seventh cell is for those of our guests, who are abnormally
+claustrophobic. They worked in Sokoban levels once, but have been deliberately
+pushed into some unreachable corner. We made the cell from glass, with large
+inner spaces, and it seems to work quite well. We even replaced the door by some
+kind of bridge system, so they don't have the feeling of being locked away.
+Their neighbors &amp;hellip a severe form of dissoziative identity disorder. They
+think of themselves being other types of stones, and mimic them. That's what
+often happens to stones that don't fit to their surrounding design, very
+tragic. Please don't ask why there are four beds for only three inmates:
+Sometimes one of them hides that well that we can't find him anymore &hellip;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;And now, some words from the director and founder of this intricate
+institution:&lt;/p&gt;

+Wow, it really is a long time ago that I created this level. I had to
+think it over for a while, but then I remembered: It was back in July
+2003 that I finished &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;. It was published besides 16
+others of my levels with the 0.81 release of Enigma.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200803_c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Oh, an extra life, very good; &lt;br&gt; those walls are
+somewhat frightening &hellip;&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I came to Enigma through the original Oxyd by Meinolf Schneider. I
+devoured every Oxyd game on my old Atari ST about 20 years ago. Besides
+having to seek for the magic codes in the book, most of the
+disappointment I experienced while playing the games, was coming of the
+restriction to play the levels in a given order. Only after having
+finished one level, you were allowed to play the next one.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I always preferred the link game, in which you have to solve the level
+together. I am looking forward to see this feature in Enigma, because it
+really is a most unique experience.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+After having played the old games several times, I stumbled across a
+very early version of Enigma, and I decided to share my Oxyd knowledge
+in the form of bug reports to the developers. I was very tempted to bring the
+project forward, but how?
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+&quot;Psycho Pushing&quot; and many of the ideas for my other levels resulted
+from studying the old Oxyd levels again. All of them were just one screen in
+size like the 6 meditation landscapes for instance, of which I myself find
+&quot;What's the problem&quot; most remarkable. With &quot;Psycho Pushing&quot;
+which was only just the third level I created, I tried to develop &quot;a bigger
+than one screen&quot; level with several different floors, items and stones.
+Maybe, that's why I hid several useless items under the stones near the border.
+And only one of these items, the umbrella, makes these shortcuts possible,
+mentioned by Ronald a short while ago. But of course, only sly foxes can profit
+from this.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+I lost sight of Enigma, but recently I inspired my six year old daughter
+to play Enigma. With a little pride I can tell her that some of the
+levels are made by me. Since I got enthusiastic again, it is possible
+that you will see some more levels by me.
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
+Many thanks to the DEV-team: Continue with your good work und keep your
+tail up!
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Sven Siggelkow&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;And many thanks to you, Sven, for this fabulous level, with its eight
+ambitious challenges! And for making us the greatest gift: A new fan!&lt;/p&gt;
+
+
+
+&lt;p&gt;Finally, a word in personal matters. On behalf of Harry and myself, I want
+to thank all of you, our faithful readers, out there for being with us through
+the last year. Together with Clifford, with Yuriy, and Joe, we managed 12
+articles about the best levels in Enigma. However, I'm sorry to announce that
+this LotM will be the last LotM penned by me for a long time. I will now
+&quot;return to the source&quot;, as Enigma 1.1 is desperately trying to hatch,
+and help Ronald and Raoul to make this happen. And to write some new levels
+myself, something I lost sight of during the last year. Harry decided to spend
+more of his time with the real important things in life like further
+investigating into &quot;The Golden Path Of Level Solving&quot; or studying
+&quot;The Marbler's Guide Through The Level Packs&quot; - or taking care of his
+towel collection. Nothing can be more frustrating - besides playing &quot;Worse
+Nightmare&quot; - than missing a starship trip because one's towel's not in good
+shape. But as long as he's crawling on this planet's face, he has offered his
+services to the Enigmian Community as a member of the editorial staff. And there
+to support and to advise future authors, and once in a while to conribute a
+comment or an article hisself.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Which means: We will provide an editorial staff to publish articles and
+players' comments from you, our readers. If you love Enigma, and love to write,
+please, send us an article about the level you most admire, or can identify
+yourself with. You can send it to us in English, German or Russian. And there's
+no obligation for you for further articles, of course. However, dear reader,
+please remember: &lt;i&gt;If you don't write this article, noone will.&lt;/i&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+If you can't decide which level you want to depict, here are four levels, which
+have very high ratings and would have become the next Levels of the Months:
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Turnstiles for Two&quot; by Ronald Lamprecht&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Pleasure Garden&quot; by Jacob Scott&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Gods of Enigma II&quot; by moonpearl&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&quot;Industrial Puzzles&quot; by Raoul Bourquin&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+Please, send articles and comments to us, as a gamer as well as an author of
+such a great level, to:
+&lt;pre&gt;
+&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/enigma-game-svn">enigma-devel at nongnu.org</A>&quot;&gt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/enigma-game-svn">enigma-devel at nongnu.org</A>&lt;/a&gt;
+&lt;/pre&gt;
+Thank you for your commitment, the future of the LotM depends on YOU!
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Best greets,&lt;br&gt;
+&lt;i&gt;Andreas &amp; Harry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;/div&gt;
