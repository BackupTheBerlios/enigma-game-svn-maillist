+
+&lt;p&gt;Summertime is vacation season. Well, marbles, do they go on vacation too? And
+if they do, what are they doing then? Lazying about and enjoying themselves? Or
+do they prefer activity vacations? Questions and more questions. Thank God,
+Lukas Sch&uuml;ller searched for answers. And with &quot;River of
+Challenges&quot; he allows us to have a look at his findings.&lt;/p&gt;

+
+&lt;h4&gt;&quot;The frustration factor of 'River of Challenges' is
+comparatively low&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;River of Challenges&quot; is nice to first-time
+&quot;visitors&quot;, because you can take a look at every part of the level
+before really starting to do anything. Also, there's no given order in which to
+tackle the different &quot;challenges&quot; which makes this level worth a try
+even for less experienced players. However, if you want to actually finish this
+level, you need skill in moving the ball as well as a bit of logic, so as not to
+make mistakes during the pushing puzzles.&lt;/div&gt; 
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Fortunately, one of the most critical passages, namely the
+race against the laser beam, can be dealt with right at the beginning, so that
+the frustration factor of &quot;River of Challenges&quot; is comparatively low.
+It takes no mastermind to solve the puzzles either, except for two &quot;booby
+traps&quot;, which cost me quite some time:&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;1) Where can I get more dynamite, in order to blow up the
+stones blocking the room with the key?&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;2) Why do I get stuck, when I build a bridge across the upper
+part of the &quot;river&quot;? (It did work in the lower right corner!)&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Eventually you reach a point (hopefully), at which you can
+(at least in theory) manage every part of the level separately. Then it's only a
+matter of time &hellip;&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Craven&lt;/div&gt;
+
+
+
+&lt;p&gt;Actually our marble wanted to go mountain climbing, but the weather forecast
+in the mountains thwarted his plans. Go to the sea? Well, being a non-swimmer
+(one would not think so, but it's true!) that wouldn't really be a marbleous
+adventure! And eventually just hanging around in some anonymous tourist trap?
+Boring! So what else? The ancient ones used to seek advice from the &quot;Gods
+of Enigma&quot; or an &quot;Oracle&quot; to help them out of difficulties, when
+they lacked ideas. Not much has changed: Even nowadays asking and listening
+won't do any harm.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;After looking around for a while, our marble found a small interesting
+location in the south &mdash; well-known just to insiders who praised it with
+wide eyes as a &quot;real cool place&quot;. So, it was easy what to decide.
+&quot;South&quot; in the summer means warm and sunny weather, and
+&quot;well-known just to insiders&quot; means a natural place with no hustle and
+bustle. At last, we've settled on our vacation spot!&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpicleft&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200809_b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Unpassable bridge&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching our destination, the first thing we have to do is sound things
+out. From afar we can see the river, which according to some locals we meet is
+suitable for white-water rafting and kayaking. So let's go and check out if
+their enthusiasm is merited. Wow! These folks are totally crazy. Boating in
+these muddy waters would surely be suicide. Branches thick as one's arm, even
+trunks are shooting past. Let's go across the bridge to have a look at the other
+side &mdash; perhaps it's more quiet over there. Oops! No way to cross this
+bridge! It seems like the river has been flooded recently, the bridge is
+damaged. That also must be the reason for all the mud and sludge around.&lt;/p&gt; 
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200809_c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;The village&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;First we will search for informations in the nearby village about what
+happened and when the repairs will be done. But the information we get there
+doesn't encourage us: The repairs will drag on for days, even weeks. &quot;Come
+again next year&quot; they tell us, &quot;or content yourself with what our
+village has to offer&quot;. At least they inform us of three persons who
+probably can help us. But two of them are very busy at the moment, and the way
+to the third one is more than just adventurous. Disheartened spirits would pack
+their bags and go home. But we wanted an activity vacation, so we take up the
+challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;For today, to limber up, we decide to examine the bridge to the south east of
+the village. Contrary to all expectations it can be repaired without too much
+fuss. So the way to two hot spots  is now free. We'll leave it at that, it's
+enough for today. We don't want to shoot all our arrows at once. Tomorrow is
+another day.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;Don't miss the &quot;bus&quot;!&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;In January of 1995, I was exploring the lost city of Petra,
+in Jordan. My companion and I took a wrong turn and found ourselves following a
+river that led out of the site toward the wilderness. We were no longer
+surrounded by columns carved into living stone by ancient human hands, but by
+nature itself.&lt;/div&gt; 
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;We hiked up the river until we came to a rope bridge across.
+We realized that our bus would be leaving soon and we were quite a distance away
+and not sure if we would get to the bus, the final one of the day, on time. We
+had to cross this precarious rope bridge carefully, so as not to fall into the
+water, and quickly, so as not to miss the bus.&lt;/div&gt; 
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200809_d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;Missed the bus.&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;This is the memory that playing &quot;River of
+Challenges&quot; triggers in me. Like many Enigma levels, there's one crucial
+task that must be mastered initially if one is to continue playing. For this
+level, it's the necessarily rapid, but careful crossing one must make to stop
+the laser that is approaching the boulder. If you miss the bus, you just have to
+restart the game and try again.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;For me, the greatest challenge isn't the mad dash across the
+drink that I allude to above, but the jumping one must do to reach the switch in
+the lower left room &mdash; it is so hard for me to get just the right amount of
+speed going before I bounce across the rivulets. I usually find myself taking a
+mighty leap and hoping to just hit the switch before I bounce into the water and
+lose one life.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I really like this level &mdash; it's visually sumptuous. The
+tasks that must be mastered vary &mdash; there's the right balance of dexterity
+and forethought required to succeed. I give &quot;River Of Challenges&quot; a
+10.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Taztunes&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The next day we set out to pay a visit to those three people who might help
+us. The first one we see seems to need help himself. Having his leg in plaster,
+B.B. Marble suggests a deal. Before his accident he had lost something
+important, that's why he sings the blues. He can't fetch it himself because of
+his limited ability to move. If we can get it for him he would of course show
+his gratitude. We agree and shake hands on the deal. He explains to us where we
+have to go and what lies ahead of us there. &quot;You'd better hurry!&quot;, he
+says.&lt;/p&gt;  
+
+&lt;p&gt;So we hurry. We get into our sportswear and out of the village to the east.
+There's no &quot;Slippery when wet&quot; sign, but at the beginning we're more
+slipping and sliding along the muddy path than walking (hoping not to waste too
+much time). But soon we can &mdash; no, we MUST &mdash; force the pace along the
+tortuous plank path. Careful! One false step would surely mean the end (aka
+Ctrl-A). Concentrate and keep up the pace! Phew! We've only just made it! First
+we need a breather, and then we return the lost article to its owner. And like
+he had promised (manus manum lavat) B.B. pulls a few strings, Lucille sings
+&quot;You're still a square, but a fl-bridge-open now&quot; &mdash; and we've
+made another considerable step forward. Let's knock off business for

+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;&quot;Swinging&quot; cross the pool&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The following morning we go to see the next person who might be able to help
+us get along. Big Bill Marble would like to come to play, but to do so he needs
+his key to the highway which he had lost when rock'n'rolling in a cave to the
+west of the village recently. Great! At least this cave is located on the way to
+the third person who has been mentioned to us as a address to turn to for help.
+As a precaution we fit ourselves out with appropriate equipment for spelunking.
+We leave the village, taking the road west, then turning off south at the next
+crossing. It's pure joy sliding down the crossroad. Well, but then suddenly
+we're stuck: the way is blocked by a pool. We need a good swing to jump across.
+Let's hope we don't lose control on the other side because of all the mud. Let's
+get going then! &hellip; Phew, that was close!&lt;/p&gt; 
+
+&lt;p&gt;And on we go. Soon we reach the cave, force our way in and take the fateful
+key. South of the cave we move west to look for the third person on our list. We
+come across two creeks which obstruct progress. But skilled as we are, with the
+right mix of speed and dexterity &mdash; we overcome even this obstacle.
+&quot;I'sorry, but I just can't help you, much as I should like to&quot; is all
+we get from Little Walter Marble at first. &quot;Try to ask around in the pub
+this evening. The pub is to the south of the marketplace at the end of the side
+road. Tell them I sent you. Everything's gonna be alright.&quot; Taking this not
+very promising advice we head for home to the village.&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;The Cave: Big Bill's lost key&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;We would have gone to a pub anyway this evening. Why not pay a visit to this
+location? No sooner said than done. Our questions are being put off until later:
+The person who might help us hasn't arrived yet. We make ourselves at home. And
+we soon make friends with the pleasent vin du pays, the meals are tasty and the
+atmosphere's enjoyable. Even waiting can be fun. After a while the expected guy
+shows up and soon joins us. He asks us what we want from him, and we tell him
+about our problems. After some (or perhaps some more) glasses of wine, John Lee
+Marble assures us of his support, and moreover gives us some helpful tips. And
+then &hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Damn it! Why is the light so glaring and why are our heads so heavy this
+morning? Oh yeah, yesterday late in the evening &mdash; or was it today early in
+the morning? &mdash; the conference seems to have lasted a little bit longer.
+According to our status quo it seems to be &mdash; no, it has to be &mdash; just
+a few hours ago since the festival came to an end. Well, it doesn't matter.
+Let's have a day off today. &mdash; Wait a minute! Isn't there something we're
+forgetting?  If only we didn't feel so lousy. Apparently we had one Bourbon, one
+Scotch, one Beer, or was it something else? Serves us right to suffer! &mdash;
+But what was it? &mdash; Actually today we wanted to?? &hellip; bridge?!?
+&hellip; hot spot just northeast of the village!?! &hellip; That's it!! But
+should we really do this to ourselves today? Since these nice people have so
+generously supported us, we can't very well disappoint them. We hope it won't be
+too hard. One pot of coffee later, but not yet fit as a fiddle, we unhurriedly
+set off to the scene of today's action.&lt;/p&gt;  
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;lotmpic&quot;&gt;
+&lt;img src=&quot;$$imagedir$$/lotm/lotm_200809_e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Level of the Month&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
+&lt;div class=&quot;imagetitle&quot;&gt;What shall we do &lt;br&gt; with the stuff from the river?
+&lt;br&gt; &hellip; early in the mornin' &hellip;&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Great! The northern bridge is passable again. Aside from the muddy path the
+other side doesn't look bad. But stop! What's that? Everything's flooded just
+before our goal!  &mdash; Didn't tell John Lee, yesterday's drinking buddy, that
+there's enough stuff lying around on the waterfront we can make use of without
+any problems? Surely, when we arrived a few days ago we almost stumbled over it.
+And there's one good thing about it: Hopefully the drudgery lying ahead of us
+will break down the residual alcohol. A little bit later after we've moved the
+first piece to the left riverside, a little problem turns up: How can we get it
+across the river? We push it to and drag it from but it won't work. Think a
+little! But that's not so easy, our heads are still aching. Hm, if we however
+&hellip; then &hellip; and with &hellip; Yes, we should succeed doing it this
+way.&lt;/p&gt; 
+
+&lt;p&gt;And in fact &mdash; finally we've reached our final goal. The strain eases.
+The last exhausting days are past. What remains is the satisfaction to have
+survived all the challenges of the river. We will certainly brag about it later
+at a certain inn while everyone is celebrating with food and drink. But we don't
+want to say a word about the consequences this time &hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;&quot;One kind of level was missing from my private level collection&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I'm very happy about this award. It's a while ago since I
+wrote the level, but I'll try to get things together.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Now that &quot;River of Challenges&quot; has been voted Level
+of the Month, things have come full circle in some respect: Since the idea for
+this level came into being shortly after I had read the first LotM article,
+which presented one of Duffy's masterpieces (on which I never really dared to
+venture I must confess). Thereby I came to realize that it was exactly this kind
+of level which was missing from my somewhat extensive private collection of
+levels (although not so extensive as the one of the author just mentioned before
+&mdash; if there's anything alike it at all ;) ): A huge level, consisting of
+lots of little puzzles, in which all the skills typical for Enigma are demanded
+from the player.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The idea to assemble some
+puzzle-stones for transporting purposes and to disassemble them again at their
+destination had occured to me some time before, so building the upper two rooms
+didn't take that long. Luckily this puzzle made it possible for me to outline a
+basic plan regarding the gaming principle as well as the design. The way to the
+other side simply was interrupted at some points and had to be reestablished by
+various actions of the player in the lower part of the level. As the main
+designing element water was the perfect match: it could easily be extended to
+represent a river.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Then I had to complete the lower area of the level with
+various challenges. My original intention was to design the level in a
+non-linear way &mdash; each of the single challenges should be within easy reach
+right from the start for practising purposes, but still there would only be one
+order, in which the individual challenges could be mastered. Well, it didn't
+quite well work out: most of the puzzles are independent of other ones.
+Particularly the passage with the laser and the breakable stones reveals the
+original idea. And also the fact that it's still me who holds the record
+indicates that there's only one optimum way (concerning time) to solve the
+level.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;After I had finished a first version and sent it to the
+developers, the level was yet far from being finished. Here once again many
+thanks to Raoul, Ronald und Andreas, who especially helped me to complete the
+left area of the level which has been nearly empty at the times. After many more
+minor changes the level was finally completed and ready to be included in the
+game.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Looking back there are some aspects I'm discontented with:
+the central challenge isn't centrally located for instance, or the fact that it
+has turned out to be a bit too time-consuming &mdash; but on the whole I'm quite
+pleased with my first and up to now only large level. But who knows, maybe in
+future others will follow.&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Lukas&lt;/div&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;It can be taken for granted our marble has to recover from such
+&quot;vacations&quot; by going about its business as an industrial manager (far
+from nature). Without dreaming that it will come across some of that
+&quot;stuff&quot; it had found near the riverbank again, when it will be facing
+the challenges at its working place at factory hall 6098. More about it next
+month. Thanks to Lukas Sch&uuml;ller. He gave us a profound insight how our
+marble is spending its vacation and why our marble sometimes seems to be so
+worn-out for its daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NObby and Harry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
+
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One more time many thanks to our travel companion Taztunes who picked up the
+pieces of our double Dutch English and put them together into something worth
+reading.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
+
