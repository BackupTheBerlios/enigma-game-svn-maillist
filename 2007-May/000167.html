--- This file demonstrates how to add a sound set to Enigma.
---
--- Sound effects are triggered by so-called &quot;sound events&quot;.
--- These sound events usually have a name (like &quot;dooropen&quot;) and
--- an associated location (the coordinates of the door) which
--- affects the way a sound effect is played.
---
--- The sound event is converted into a real sound effect using
--- tables similar to the one below.  Each entry in the table is
--- either a string like &quot;st-coinslot&quot;, which is interpreted as
--- referring to file &quot;st-coinslot.wav&quot; and default properties or
--- a list of sound attributes enclosed in curly braces &quot;{ ... }&quot;.
---
--- Here is a complete example of such an attribute list:
---
---      dooropen = { file=&quot;open-door&quot;, volume=0.9, priority=4, global=0 },
---
--- The meaning of these attributes is as follows:
---
---      file     - Path and name of the sound file for this event, without
---                 the&quot;.wav&quot; extension.
---
---      volume   - The sound volume: 1.0 is standard, 0.0 is silent.
---
---      priority - If many effects are active at the same time, high-priority
---                 effects can replace lower-priority effects. Use an integer
---                 between 1 and 10 (default 1).
---
---      global   - Either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.  If true, no stereo effects are
---                 applied and there is no attenuation.  Used for menu sound,
---                 level end sounds, etc. Default is &quot;false&quot;.
---
---      loop     - &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.  If true, the sound repeats infinitely
---                 until canceled. Default is &quot;false&quot;. 
---
---      damp_max, damp_inc, damp_mult, damp_min, damp_tick
---               - Parameters for sound damping.  Sounds from noisy objects
---                 like light passengers are damped to reduce the noise.
---                 For this, the sound event's frequency is estimated.
---                 damp_max calibrates the maximal damping factor (high means
---                 quiet), damp_inc how fast the damping accumulates,
---                 damp_mult is an overall factor, damp_min defines a lower
---                 bound for the damping entries (beyond which they are
---                 removed from memory) and damp_tick the factor that's
---                 applied all 0.1 seconds. Defaults: 10.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.9.
---
--- To design a new sound set, proceed as follows.
---
--- 1) Create a new folder containing this file (named &quot;sound.lua&quot;)
---    and the wav files you want to use.  
---
--- 2) Move this new folder into Enigma's &quot;sound&quot; folder.  The directory
---    structure should look something like this
---
---      (user path)/sound/my_sounds/
---                                 /sound.lua
---                                 /a.wav
---                                 /b.wav
---                                 ...
---
--- 3) Run Enigma.  Since this file sets does not map any sound effect to a
---    wav file, you should hear nothing
---
--- 4) Edit the contents of this file to your liking.  You can access the
---    default sound files directly, but remember to add the subfolder for
---    own sound files (like &quot;{ file=&quot;my_sounds/b.wav&quot; }&quot;).
---
--- 5) Replace &quot;MY_SOUNDSET&quot; by a suitable variable name, and &quot;My Soundset&quot;
---    by the name you want to see in the sound options menu.  Remember to
---    make it short enough to fit on the button.
---
--- If you need inspiration, take a look at &quot;sound-defaults.lua&quot; shipped with
--- Enigma, which contains the default sound table.
---
--- If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.  Have fun!
